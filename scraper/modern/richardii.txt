It was a terrible sin and troubles me greatly. But I confessed it already and specifically begged your pardon, and I hoped you had forgiven me. That is my fault.

Youve interfered with their happy marriage and caused the queen suffering. I, by the luck of my birth, am a prince. I am closely related to the king, and until you changed his feelings toward me, he loved me. Because of your actions, Ive had to live in exile in a foreign country, and meanwhile you lived off my wealth and property here, leasing my hunting grounds to others and cutting down my forests. You tore my familys coat of arms out of the windows of my house and destroyed all signs of my familys existence.

Both old and young people were looking out on him with happy desire, and on the painted walls all around was written, Jesus protect you! Welcome, Bolingbroke!

But because the world is full of people and Im the only one here, I cannot do it. Yet Ill work it out. My brain and my soul will produce enough thoughts to fill this little world, like people in the outside world and just as discontented. The better kind of thought, like the thought of divine things, is mixed with doubts and compares passages from scripture, like Come, little ones and It is as hard for a rich man to enter heaven as for a camel to pass through a needles eye. Both passages involve the easeor difficultyof reaching heaven. Come, little ones and It is as hard for a rich man to enter heaven as for a camel to pass through a needles eye. Ambitious thoughts plot unlikely miracles, such as digging through the walls of my cell by hand, and these thoughts die in their prime because they are futile. Contented thoughts tell themselves that they arent the first to be a slave to fortune, and they wont be the last. Theyre like beggars in the stocks who take comfort in the fact that others have already sat there and more will sit there. So I host many people inside my own head, and none are content. Sometimes Im king, and then some treason makes me wish I was a beggar, and so then I am a beggar. Then terrible poverty persuades me that I was better off as king, so then I am king again. And then I think that I have been dethroned by Bolingbroke, and suddenly Im nothing. But whatever I am, just like all men, Ill never be happy until I am dead and nothing at all. Do I hear music? Ha! Keep time. How awful music is when they dont keep time and the notes proportions are ruined. Its the same thing in mens lives. And here I can chastise the poor time kept on an out-of-tune instrument, when in the harmony of my government and life I couldnt hear my own time breaking. I wasted time then, and now time wastes me. Time has made me his clock: my thoughts have become minutes that turn the clock hands in my eyes, and my finger is the dial that wipes away my tears. Now, sir, my groans are like the sounds that toll the hours, and theyre made by striking my heart, which is the bell. Thus my sighs, tears, and groans signify minutes and hours. Meanwhile, my time speeds on as Bolingbroke has his joy, and Im left here playing the clock for him. This music makes me crazy. Let it stop. It might make madmen sane, but for me, it makes a wise man mad. Yet bless the heart that plays it for me!
