RODERIGO
Come on, dont tell me that. I dont like itthat you knew about this, Iago. All this time Ivethought you were such a good friend that Ive let youspend my money as if it was yours.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Damn it, youre not listening to me! I never dreamedthis was happeningif you find out I did, you can goahead and hate me.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
You told me you hated him.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
I do hate himThey\re talking about Othello, though they never mention his name.him, I swear. Three of Venices mostimportant noblemen took their hats off to him and asked him humblyto make me his lieutenant, the second in command. And I know my ownworth well enough to know I deserve that position. But he wants tohave things his own way, so he sidesteps the issue with a lot ofmilitary talk and refuses their request. Ivealready chosen my lieutenant, he says. And who does hechoose? A guy who knows more about numbers than fighting! This guyfrom Florence named Michael Cassio. He has a pretty wife but hecant even control her. And hes definitelynever commanded men in battle. Hes got no more hands-onknowledge of warfare than an old womanunless you countwhat hes read in books,
</T>
<T>
which any peace-lover can do. His military understanding is alltheory, no practice. But Cassios been chosen over me. Mycareer is cut short by some bookkeeper, even though the general sawmy fighting skills first-hand in Rhodes and Cyprus. This accountantis now lieutenant, while I end up as the MoorsMoor = North AfricanMoors flag-bearer.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
By God, Id rather be his executioner.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
And theres nothing I can do about it.Thats the curse of military service. You get promotedwhen someone likes you, not because youre next in line.Now, you tell me: should I feel loyal to the Moor?
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
If you dont like him you should quit.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
No, calm down. Im serving under him to take advantageof him. We cant all be masters, and not all mastersshould be followed. Look at all the devoted servants who work fortheir masters their whole lives for nothing but their food, and thenwhen they get old theyre terminated. They ought to bewhipped for being so stupid. But then theres anotherkind of servant who looks dutiful and devoted, but whosreally looking out for himself. By pretending to serve their lords,these men get rich, and when theyve saved up enough theycan be their own masters. Guys like that have soul, andthats the kind of guy I am. Let me tell
</T>
<T>
you, as sure as your names Roderigo, if I were theMoor I wouldnt want to be Iago. I may seem to love andobey him, but in fact, Im just serving him to get what Iwant. If my outward appearance started reflecting what I reallyfelt, soon enough Id be wearing my heart on my sleevefor birds to peck at. No, its better to hide it.Im not who I appear to be.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Thick-lipsThick-lips is a racial slur toward the Moor, Othello.Thick-lips sure is lucky if he can pull this off!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Lets shout up to Desdemonas father, wakehim, pester him, spoil his happiness, spread rumors about him in thestreets, enrage his relatives, and irritate him endlessly. Howeverreal his happiness is, it will vanish in light of this.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Heres her fathers house. Illcall out.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Do it, and shout like the citys on fire.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Hey, Brabantio! Signor Brabantio, hey!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Wake up, Brabantio! Wake up! Thieves! Thieves! Check on yourdaughter, your house, your money! Thieves! Thieves!
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Whats the reason for this horrible shouting?Whats the matter?
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Sir, is everyone in your family at home?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Are your doors locked?
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Why are you asking me that?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
For Gods sake, sir, youve been robbed. Getdressed. Your hearts going to break. Itslike half your souls been ripped out. At this veryminute an old black ram is having sex with your little white lamb.Wake up, wake up, ring a bell and wake up all the snoring citizens.If you wait too long youll have black grandchildren. Getup, I tell you!
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Are you crazy?
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Do you recognize my voice, noble lord?
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Not me. Who are you?
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
My names Roderigo.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
I told you not to hang around my house. Ive alreadytold you quite plainly that my daughter will never marry you. Nowyou come here drunk to make trouble and startle me out of a soundsleep?
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Sir, sir, sir
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
You know Im powerful enough to make you pay for this.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Please wait, sir.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Why are you talking about robbery? This is Venice. My houseisnt in some remote countryside.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Brabantio, with all due respect, Im here out ofcourtesy and good will. Ive come to tell you
</T>
<T>
IAGO
My God, sir, youre stubborn and suspicious. We comehere to help you and you treat us like thugs, but you let an Africanhorse climb all over your daughter. Your grandsons will neigh to youlike horses. Your whole family will be ruined.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
What kind of crude jerk are you?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
The kind that tells you that the Moor is having sex with yourdaughter right now.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Youre a villain!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Youre a senator!
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Youre going to pay for this, Roderigo. I know who youare.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Ill answer for everything. I dont know ifyou know or approve of this, but in the wee hours of the morningyour daughter left your house, with no better escort than a hiredgondolier, to go into the rough embrace of a lustful Moor. If all ofthis happened with your
</T>
<T>
approval, then weve been very rude to bother you likethis. But if you didnt know about it, then you werewrong to get mad at us. Id never play pranks on you. Ifyou didnt allow your daughter to do whatshes doing, then shes rebelling against you.Shes throwing her life away on some stranger. Go ahead,see for yourself if shes in her bedroom. If she is, youcan sue me for lying to you.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Light the candles! Wake up my whole household! I dreamt aboutthis. Im starting to worry its true. Give mesome light!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
(to RODERIGO)
Its time for me to say goodbye to you. It would beinappropriatedangerous, evenfor me to beseen working against the Moor, as I would if I stayed. The Venetiangovernment might reprimand him for this, but it cantsafely get rid of him, since it needs him urgently for the imminentCyprus wars. They couldnt find another man with hisabilities to lead their armed forcesnot if their soulsdepended on it. I hate him, but Ive got to show himsigns of loyalty
</T>
<T>
and affection, even if its just an act. If you want tofind him, send the search party to the Sagittarius Inn. He and Iwill be there.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Its true. Shes gone. The rest of my lifewill be nothing but bitterness. Now, Roderigo, where did you seeher?Oh, that miserable wretch!You say yousaw her with the Moor?Oh, who would want to be afather?How did you know it was her?To thinkshe tricked me so easily!What did she say toyou?Get me more candles, and wake up all my relatives.Do you think theyre married?
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Yes, I really think so.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Oh, heaven, how did she get out? My own flesh and blood rebelsagainst me! Fathers, never trust your daughters just because theyact obedient and innocent. Are there magic spells that can leadyoung virgins astray? Have you ever heard of anything like that,Roderigo?
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Yes, sir, I have.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Call my brother.Now I wish youd marriedher!Some of you go one way, some the otherway.Do you know where we can find her and the Moor?
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
I think I can find him. Get together a group of armed men andfollow me.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Lead the way. Ill stop at every house. Imrespected enough that most of them will do what Isay.Get your weapons! And get the officers who guard thecity at night.Lets go, Roderigo.Ill reward you for your troubles.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Ive killed many men in battle, but I still believeits deeply wrong to murder someone. Sometimes I worryIm not cruel enough for this job. Nine or ten times Iwanted to stab him under the ribs.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Its better that you didnt kill him.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
But he kept chattering so foolishly, talking about you in suchinsulting and despicable terms, that it was hard for me to restrainmyself. But please tell me, sir, is your marriage secureIago may be asking whether Othello has consummated his marriage by sleeping with Desdemona yet. A marriage could be annulled if it had never been consummated.secure? Brabantiois an important man in this city, almost as powerful as the dukehimself. Hell try to annul your marriage, or elseinflict whatever punishment the law and his power will allow him to.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Let him do his worst. The services I have done for the Venetiangovernment will count for more than his complaints will. No oneknows this yetand I dont like to brag, but Icome from a royal family, and Im as noble as the womanIve married. And let me tell you, Iago, if Ididnt love Desdemona as much as I do, Idnever agree to get married and lose my freedom at all. But look atthose lights. Whos coming?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Thats her father and his friends, whovebeen roused out of bed. Youd better go inside.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
No, I must let them find me. My good qualities, my legal status asDesdemonas husband, and my innocence will protect me. Isit them?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
I dont think so.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant? Hello, everyone!Whats going on?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
The Duke sends his regards. He needs to see you right away.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
What do you think he wants?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Something about Cyprus. I think its important. Thewarships have sent a dozen messages tonight, one after the other,and many of the senators have been awakened and are at theDukes already. Theyre very anxious for youto get there. When you werent at home, the Senate sentout three different search parties to find you.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Its good you found me. Ill just speak aword or two here in the house and then Ill go with you.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Ensign, whats he doing in there?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Tonight he boarded a treasure ship. If he can keep it,hell be set forever.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
I dont understand.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Hes married.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
To whom?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
To
</T>
<T>
Are you ready?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Yes, Ill go with you now.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Here comes another group looking for you.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Its Brabantio. Look out, sir. He intends to dosomething bad to you.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Hey! Stop right there!
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Sir, its the Moor.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Get him, hes a thief!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
You, Roderigo! Come on, Ill fight you.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Put away your swords. Theyll get rusty in the dew.Sir, your age and status inspire more respect than your weapons do.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
You evil thief, where have you hidden my daughter? You devil,youve put a spell on her! Anybody with eyes could tellyou that a beautiful and happy young girl like her, whosrefused to marry all of the handsome young men of the city,wouldnt run off with a black thing like you unlessshed been bewitched. Youre something tofear, not to love. Its obvious to everyone thatyouve tricked her, drugged her, or kidnapped her.Thats probably what happened, so Imarresting you.Arrest this man as a practitioner of blackmagic. Grab him. If he struggles, use force!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Just a minute. I dont need anyone to tell me when tofight. Youve accused me of some serious crimes. Where doyou want me to go to respond to these charges?
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
To prison, until youre called into court.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
What if I do what you say? How would I satisfy the Duke then? Hismessengers are waiting here to take me to him immediately, onpressing state business.
</T>
<T>
OFFICER
Its true. The Dukes in a meeting rightnow, and hes sent for you too.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
The Dukes in a meeting? At this time of night? Bringhim with us. The laws on my side. The Duke and any of myfellow senators will take this wrong as seriously as if it weretheir own. If we let crimes like this happen, slaves and heathenswill be our rulers.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
These reports are inconsistent. You cant trust them.
</T>
<T>
FIRST SENATOR
Its true, theyre inconsistent. My letterssay there are a hundred and seven ships.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
And mine say a hundred and forty.
</T>
<T>
SECOND SENATOR
And mine say two hundred. But often in these cases, reports arejust estimates. The important thing is that they all say a Turkishfleet is approaching Cyprus.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Yes, we get the idea. The inconsistency doesnt make methink that the reports are all wrong. I have no doubt about whattheyre basically saying, and itsfrightening.
</T>
<T>
SAILOR
(offstage) Hello! Hey, hello!
</T>
<T>
OFFICER
Its a messenger from the warships.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Why are you here?
</T>
<T>
SAILOR
Signor Angelo told me to come here and tell you that the Turkishfleet is heading for Rhodes, not Cyprus.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
What do you think about this change?
</T>
<T>
FIRST SENATOR
They cant have changed; theres no way thiscould be true. Its a trick to confuse us. Think abouthow important Cyprus is to the Turks, and remember that they couldcapture Cyprus more easily, since it isnt as wellprotected as Rhodes is. If we keep these things in mind, wecant possibly imagine that the Turks would be soincompetent as to put off for last what they want to achieve first,setting aside something easy and profitable to do somethingdangerous and pointless.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
No, I think we can be confident that the Turks arentreally headed for Rhodes.
</T>
<T>
OFFICER
Heres some more news coming in.
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
Sir, the Turks sailed to Rhodes, where they joined with anotherfleet.
</T>
<T>
FIRST SENATOR
Thats just what I thought. How many, can you guess?
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
Thirty ships. Now theyve turned around and are clearlyheading for Cyprus. Signor Montano, your brave and loyal servant,gives you this information and asks you to send reinforcements torelieve him.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Then its certain theyre heading forCyprus. Is Marcus Luccicos in town?
</T>
<T>
FIRST SENATOR
No, hes in Florence.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Write to him immediately. Hurry.
</T>
<T>
FIRST SENATOR
Here come Brabantio and the brave Moor.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Brave Othello, I have to send you right away to fight the Turks,our great enemy.(to BRABANTIO) Oh, Ididnt see you there. Welcome, sir. I could have usedyour wisdom and help tonight.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
I could have used yours as well. Forgive me, your grace. Ididnt get out of bed and come here in the dead of nightbecause I heard about the war or because I was worried about thecitys defense. I have a personal problem so painful andgut-wrenching that it overwhelms everything else.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Why, whats the matter?
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Its my daughter! Oh, my daughter!
</T>
<T>
FIRST SENATOR
Is she dead?
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Shes dead to me. Shes been tricked andstolen from me, enchanted by black magic spells. Shemustve
</T>
<T>
been tricked or drugged, because theres no way shecould have made this mistake on her own.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Whoever tricked your daughter and stole her from you will pay forit. And you yourself will determine the sentence as you see fit, andimpose the death penalty if you choose to, even if the criminal weremy own son.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
I humbly thank you, sir. Here is the man, the Moor. It seems youhad your own reasons for summoning him here.
</T>
<T>
ALL
Were sorry to hear this.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
(to OTHELLO) What do you have to say for yourself?
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Nothing, but this is true.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Noble, honorable gentlemen whom I serve: its true thatIve taken this mans daughter from him andmarried her. But thats my only offense.Theres nothing more. Im awkward in my speechand Im not a smooth talker. From the time I was sevenyears old until nine months ago Ive been fighting inbattles. I dont know much about the world apart fromfighting. So I wont do myself much good by speaking inmy own defense. But if youll let me, Illtell you the plain
</T>
<T>
story of how we fell in love, and what drugs, charms, spells, andpowerful magicbecause thats whatIm being accused ofI used to win hisdaughter.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Shes a good girl, quiet and obedient. She blushes atthe slightest thing. And you want me to believe that despite heryoung age and proper upbringing she fell in love with a manshed be afraid to look at? The very thought of it isridiculous. Youd have to be stupid to think that someoneso perfect could make such an unnatural mistake as that. The devilmust be behind this. Therefore I say again that he must have usedsome powerful drug or magic potion on her.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Your saying this isnt proof. There has to be clearevidence that hes done this, not just these accusations.
</T>
<T>
FIRST SENATOR
Tell us, Othello. Did you trick or deceive this lady in some way?Or did you agree to this as equals?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Please, send for Desdemona to come here from the Sagittarius Innand ask her to speak about me in front
</T>
<T>
of her father. If she has anything bad to say about me, then youcan sentence me to death.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Bring Desdemona here.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Iago, bring Desdemona here. You know where she is.
</T>
<T>
In the meantime Ill tell you all, as honestly as Iconfess my sins to God, how I wooed this beautiful lady, and how shecame to love me.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Tell us, Othello.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Her father loved me and used to invite me to his house often,continually asking me about my life and all the battlesIve fought. I told him everything, from my boyhood upuntil the time when I was talking to him. I told him aboutunfortunate disasters, hair-raising adventures on sea and on land,and near-catastrophes and dangerous adventures Ive beenthrough. I told him how I was captured and sold as a slave, how Ibought my freedom, and how I wandered through caves and deserts. Iwas able to tell him about cannibals who eat each other, and menwith heads growing below their shoulders. When I talked about allthese things, Desdemona used to listen attentively. If she had to godo some household chore, I noticed that shed always comeback quickly to hear more of my stories.
</T>
<T>
When I was relaxing, shed pull me aside and ask tohear some part of a story she had missed. Her eyes would fill withtears at the bad things I went through in my younger years. When mystories were done, shed sigh and tell me how strangelywonderful and sad my life had been. She said she wished shehadnt heard it, but she also wished there was a man likeme for her. She thanked me and told me that if a friend of mine hada story like mine to tell, shed fall in love with him. Itook the hint and spoke to her. She said she loved me for thedangers Id survived, and I loved her for feeling suchstrong emotions about me. Thats the only witchcraft Iever used. Here comes my wife now. Shell confirmeverything.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
I think a story like that would win my own daughter over.Brabantio, I urge you to make the best of this. Try to acceptwhats happened.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Please let her speak. If she admits she wanted this, then Iwont blame Othello.Come here, my child. Whodo you obey here?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Father, this isnt easy for me. Im torn. Iowe you respect because you gave me life and education.Youre the one I have to obey. Im yourdaughter. But this man here is my husband now, and I owe him as muchas my mother owed you, just as she preferred you to her own father.So I have to give my obedience to the Moor, my husband.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Im finished, then. Duke, please go ahead with yourstate business. Id rather adopt a child than have one ofmy own.Come here, Moor. Im forced to give myblessing to this marriage. With all my heart, I give you that thingwhich, if you didnt already have it, Id trywith all my heart to keep from you. Desdemona, Im gladyoure my only child, since if I had othersId keep them all locked up. You would have made me treatthem like a tyrant.Im done, my lord.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Let me refer to a proverb that may help you forgive these lovers:if you cant change something, dont cry aboutit. When you lament something bad thats alreadyhappened, youre setting yourself up for more
</T>
<T>
bad news. A robbery victim who can smile about his losses issuperior to the thief who robbed him, but if he crieshes just wasting time.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
So if the Turks steal Cyprus from us, it wont be badas long as we keep smiling. Its easy to acceptplatitudes like that if you havent lost anything. ButIve lost something precious, and I have to put up withthe platitude as well as suffering my loss. Talk is cheap.Ive never heard of someone feeling better because ofsomeone elses words. Please, Im asking you,go ahead and get back to your state affairs.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
The Turks are heading for Cyprus with a powerful fleet. Othello,you understand better than anyone how the defenses for Cyprus work.Even though we have a very good officer in charge there already,everyone says youre the better man for the job. SoIll have to ask you to put a damper on your marriagecelebrations and take part in this dangerous expedition.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Ive gotten used to the hardships of a military life. Irise to the occasion when faced with difficulties. I will takecharge of this war against the Turks. But I humbly ask you to makeappropriate arrangements for my wife,
</T>
<T>
giving her a place to live and people to keep her company thatsuit her high rank.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
She can stay at her fathers house.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
I wont allow it.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Neither will I.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
And I wouldnt stay there. I dont want toupset my father by being in his house. Dear Duke, please listen towhat I have to say.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
What do you want to do, Desdemona?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
When I fell in love with Othello I made up my mind that I wantedto live with him. You can see how much I wanted to be with him byhow violently I threw away my old life. I feel like Im apart of him now, and that means Im part of a soldier. Isaw Othellos true face when I saw his mind. I gave mywhole life to him because of his honor and bravery. If I were leftat home uselessly while he went off to war, then Imseparated from my husband in his natural element. Id bemiserable without him. Let me go with him.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Please allow her to do this. Im not asking to have hernear me for sexIm too old for that, and mysexual
</T>
<T>
urges are dead. I want this because she wants itI loveher for her mind. And Id never want you to think thatId neglect my serious official duties while she wasthere with me. If I ever let love blind me so that I choose tolounge around in bed with my loved one instead of going off to war,then you can let a housewife use my helmet as a frying pan. Myreputation would be disgraced if I ever acted like that.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
You can decide that privately. I dont care whether shestays or goes. Whats important is the urgency of thismission. Youve got to act fast.
</T>
<T>
FIRST SENATOR
Youll have to leave tonight.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
With all my heart, Ill go right away.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Well meet again at nine in the morning. Othello, haveone of your officers stay behind to bring you your commission andwhatever else is important to you.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
My lord, my ensign is an honest and trustworthy man.Hell accompany my wife, and bring whatever else youthink I might need.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
All right, then. Good night, everyone.(to BRABANTIO) Sir, if goodness is beautiful, your son-in-law isbeautiful, not black.
</T>
<T>
FIRST SENATOR
Goodbye, black Moor. Treat Desdemona well.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Keep an eye on her, Moor. She lied to me, and she may lie to you.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Id bet my life shed never lie to me. Iago,Im leaving my dear Desdemona with you. Have your wifeattend to her, and bring them along as soon as you can. Come on,Desdemona, Ive only got an hour of love to spend withyou, to tell you what you need to do. Were on a tightschedule.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Iago.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
What do you have to say, noble friend?
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
What do you think I should do?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Go to bed, and sleep.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Im going to go drown myself.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
If you do that, Ill never respect you again. Why, yousilly man!
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Its silly to live when life is torture. The only cureis death.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Oh, how stupid! Ive been alive for twenty-eight years,and Ive never met a man who knew what was good for him.Id rather be a baboon than kill myself out of love forsome woman I cant have.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
What should I do? I know its foolish to be so much inlove, but I cant help it.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Cant help it? Nonsense! What we are is up to us. Ourbodies are like gardens and our willpower is like the gardener.Depending on what we plantweeds or lettuce, or one kindof herb rather than a variety, the garden will either be barren anduseless, or rich and productive. If we didnt haverational minds to counterbalance our emotions and desires, ourbodily urges would take over. Wed end up in ridiculoussituations. Thankfully, we have reason to cool our raging lusts. Inmy opinion, what you call love is just an offshoot of lust.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
I dont believe it.
</T>

IAGO
You feel love because you feel lust and you have no willpower.Come on, be a man. Drown yourself? Drowning is for cats or blindpuppiesdont drown yourself! Ivetold you Im your friend, and Ill stickby you.
</T>
<T>
Ive never been more useful to you than I will benow. Heres what youll do. Sell all yourassets and your land, and turn it into cash. Desdemonacant continue loving the Moor any more than he cancontinue loving her. She fell in love with him very suddenly, andtheyll break up just as suddenly. Moors are moodypeople.So sell your lands and raise a lot of cash. Whatseems sweet to him now will soon turn bitter. Shell dumpOthello for a younger man. When shes had enough of theMoors body, shell realize her mistake.Shell need to have a new lover. Shell haveto have it. So have your money ready. If you want to go to hell,there are better ways to do it than killing yourself. Raise all themoney you can. I can get the better of religion and a few flimsyvows between a misguided barbarian and a depraved Venetian girl.Youll get to sleep with herjust put togethersome money. And to hell with drowning yourself! Thatscompletely beside the point. If youre ready to die, youcan risk death by committing crimes in an attempt to get the womanyou want. Dont just give up on her and drown yourself.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Can I count on you if I wait to see what happens?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
You can trust me. Go now and get cash. I told you before, andIll tell you again and again: I hate the Moor.Im devoted to my cause of hating him, just as devoted asyou are to yours. So lets join forces and get revenge.If you seduce Desdemona and make a fool out of him, itllbe fun for both of us. Many things may happen. Go get money.Well speak again tomorrow. Goodbye.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Where will we meet in the morning?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
At my house.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Ill be there early.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Go home. Goodbye. Oh, and one more thing
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
What is it?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
No more talk about killing yourself, okay?
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Ive changed my mind about that.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Go then, goodbye. Put a lot of cash together.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Im going to sell all my land.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Thats how I always do it, getting money from fools.Id be wasting my skills dealing with an idiot like thatif I couldnt get something useful out of him. I hate theMoor, and theres a widespread rumor that hesslept with my wife. Im not sure its true,but just the suspicion is enough for me. He thinks highly of me.Thatll help. Cassios a handsome man.Lets see, how can I
</T>
<T>
get his position and use him to hurt Othello at the same time?How? How? Lets see. After a while Ill starttelling Othello that Cassio is too intimate with Desdemona. Cassiois a smooth talker and a good-looking guy, the sort of man thatpeople would expect to be a seducer. The Moor is open andstraightforward. He thinks any man who seems honest is honest.People like that are easy to manipulate. So its alldecided. Ive worked it out. With a little help from thedevil, Ill bring this monstrous plan to success.
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
What can you see out on the ocean?
</T>
<T>
FIRST GENTLEMAN
Nothing. The waters so rough that I cantsee any sails, either in the bay or on the ocean.
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
It was windy on shore too. A big blast of wind shook ourfortifications. How could a ship made out of wood hold together inthose mountainous waves? What do you think will be the result ofthis storm?
</T>
<T>
SECOND GENTLEMAN
The Turkish navy will be broken up. The winds whippingup the waves so high you expect them to reach the clouds and splashagainst the stars in the sky. Ive never seen the watersso disturbed.
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
If the Turkish fleet isnt protected in some harbor,their men must all be drowned. No ship could survive this storm.
</T>
<T>
THIRD GENTLEMAN
Ive got news, boys, the wars over! Thisterrible storm has smashed the Turks so badly that their plans areruined. One of our ships has reported that it saw most of theirfleet shipwrecked.
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
What? Is this true?
</T>
<T>
THIRD GENTLEMAN
The ships sailing into harbor now; itsfrom Verona. Michael Cassio, lieutenant of the Moor Othello, hasarrived on shore. The Moor himself is still at sea. Hesbeen commissioned to come here to Cyprus.
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
Im happy about that. Hell be a goodgovernor.
</T>
<T>
THIRD GENTLEMAN
Cassio brings good news about the Turkish defeat, buthes worried about the Othellos safety. Thetwo of them were separated during the storm.
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
I hope to God Othellos all right. I served under him,and I know what an excellent commander he is. Lets go tothe shore to get a look at the ship that came in, and to look outfor Othellos ship. Well stare out at the seauntil the sea and the sky blur together.
</T>
<T>
THIRD GENTLEMAN
Lets do that. Every minute we expect more ships toarrive.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Thanks, you brave men who defend this island and respect Othello.I hope heaven protects him from the weather, because I lost sight ofhim on the stormy sea.
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
Is his ship sturdy?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Yes, its well built, and the ships pilotis very expert and experienced. For that reason I still have somehope for him, even though I dont have my hopes up toohigh.
</T>
<T>
A VOICE
(offstage) A sail! A sail! A sail!
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Whats all that shouting about?
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
Everybody in town is down at the shore shouting Asail!
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
I hope its Othello.
</T>
<T>
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Theyve fired a greeting shot, so at leastits a friendly ship.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Please go find out for certain who has arrived.
</T>
<T>
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Ill do that.
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
Good lieutenant, is your general married?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Yes, and hes very lucky to have married the woman hedid. His wife defies description. Shes Godsmasterpiece, and shed exhaust whoever tried to do herjustice while praising her.
</T>
<T>
Whos arrived in the harbor?
</T>
<T>
SECOND GENTLEMAN
A man named Iago, the generals ensign.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
He made good time. You see how the storm, the jagged rocks, andthe sand banks that trap ships all appreciate a beautiful woman.They let the heavenly Desdemona arrive safe and sound.
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
Whos that?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Shes the one I was talking about, thegenerals wife. The brave Iago was put in charge ofbringing her here, and hes arrived a week sooner than weexpected. Dear God, please protect Othello and help him arrive heresafely, so he and Desdemona can be in each others arms,and Othello can cheer us up and bring comfort to Cyprus.
</T>
<T>
Look, the precious Desdemona has arrived on shore. We should allkneel before her, men of Cyprus! Greetings, my lady, and may Godalways be with you.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Thank you, brave Cassio. Is there any news about my husband?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
He hasnt arrived yet. As far as I know,hes okay and will arrive here soon.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Oh, but Im worried. How did you two get separated?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
The storm separated us.
</T>
<T>
A VOICE
(offstage) A sail! A sail!
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Listen, theyve spotted another ship!
</T>
<T>
SECOND GENTLEMAN
They fired a greeting shot too, so this is also a friendly ship.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Go find out the news.
</T>
<T>
Ensign Iago, welcome.And welcome to you, too, madam. (he kisses EMILIA) Dont be upset that Ikissed your wife hello, Iago. Its a courtesy where Icome from.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
If she gave you as much lip as she gives me, youd besick of her by now.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
On the contrary, shes a soft-spoken woman.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
No, she talks too much. Shes always talking when Iwant to sleep. I admit that in front of you, my lady, she keeps abit quiet. But shes scolding me silently.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
You have no reason to say that.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Come on, come on. You women are all the same. Youre aspretty as pictures when youre out in public, but in yourown houses youre as noisy as jangling bells. In your ownkitchens you act like wildcats. You make yourselves sound likesaints when youre complaining about something, but youact like devils when someone offends you. You dont takeyour jobs as housewives seriously, and youre shamelesshussies in bed.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Shame on you, you slanderer!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
No, its true, or if its not,Im a villain. You wake up to have fun, and you startwork when you go to bed.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
You clearly have nothing good to say about me.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
No, I dont.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
But if you had to say something nice about me, what would you say?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Dont make me do it, my lady. Im criticalby nature.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Come on, just try.By the way, has someone gone down tothe harbor?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Yes, madam.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Im not as happy as I seem. Im just tryingnot to show how worried I am about Othellos safety. Comeon, what would you say about me?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Im trying to think of something, but Imnot good at inventing clever things. It takes time. Ah,Ive got it. If a woman is pretty and smart, she uses hergood looks to get what she wants.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Very clever! But what if the woman is smart but ugly?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Even if shes ugly, shell be smart enoughto find a guy to sleep with her.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
This is getting worse and worse!
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
What if shes pretty but stupid?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
No pretty woman is stupid, because her stupidity will make hermore attractive to men.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
These are stupid old jokes that men tell each other in bars. Whathorrible thing do you have to say about a woman whosboth ugly and stupid?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
No matter how ugly or stupid the woman is, she plays the samedirty tricks that the smart and pretty ones do.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
You dont know a thing! You give your best praise tothe worst women. But how would you praise a truly good woman,someone who had no reason to worry about what anyone said about her?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
A woman who was beautiful but never proud, who could speak wellbut knew when to be quiet, who dressed well but was neveroverdressed, who had self-restraint even when she could get what shewanted, a woman who never took revenge, who overlooked it whenpeople hurt her, who was too wise to do anything stupid, who couldthink without revealing her thoughts, and who could refrain fromflirting with men in love with her, that kind of woman, if she everexisted, would
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Would do what?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Would raise babies and clip coupons.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Oh, thats pathetic! Dont listen to him,Emilia, even though hes your husband. What do you thinkabout him, Cassio? Isnt he a horrible man?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
He speaks bluntly, madam. Hes more of a soldier than awise man.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
(to himself) Hes takingher hand. Thats right, go ahead and whisper together.This is all I need to get Cassio. Yes, keep smiling at her, Cassio. Your fine manners aroundwomen will be your downfall. Oh, Im sureyoure saying something very clever.
</T>
<T>
If you lose your jobbecause of little flirtations like this, youll wish youhadnt been so courteous with her. Oh, how nice,youre kissingA gentlemans kissing his own fingers was considered a polite gesture.kissing your own hand, one finger at a time? I wish those fingerswere enema tubes!
</T>
<T>
Thats the Moor! I recognize his trumpet.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Yes, it is.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Lets go greet him when he lands.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Look, here he comes.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
My beautiful warrior!
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
My darling Othello!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Im amazed you got here before me. But Imoverjoyed! My love, if the calm after the storm could always be thiswonderful, Id want the wind to blow until it waked thedead, and whipped up waves as tall as mountains! If I died right nowId be completely happy, since Ill probablynever be as happy as this again in my life.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
God willing, our love and our happiness will only increase as weget older.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Amen to that! I cant talk about my happiness anymore.Its too much. I hope these kisses Im aboutto give you are the closest we ever come to fighting.(they kiss)
</T>
<T>
IAGO
(to himself) Oh, yourehappy now, but Ill ruin your happiness, for all mysupposed honesty.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Lets go up to the castle. Good news, friends. Thewars over and the Turks are drowned. How are my oldfriends from this island doing?Honey, theylllove you here in Cyprus. Theyve been very good to mehere. Oh, my dear, Im blabbing on and on becauseIm so happy.Iago, would you be good enoughto go get my trunks from the ships? And bring the shipscaptain to the castle. Hes a goodman.Lets go, Desdemona. Ill sayit again: Im so happy to see you here in Cyprus!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Meet me down at the harbor.Come here. They say lovemakes cowards brave. So if youre brave, listen to me.Lieutenant Cassio will be on guard duty tonight. But first, I haveto tell you that Desdemonas completely in love with him.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
With Cassio? Thats impossible.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Be quiet and listen to me. Remember how she fell madly in lovewith the Moor because he bragged and told her made-up stories? Didyou expect her to keep on loving him for his chattering?Youre too smart to think that. No, she needs someonenice-looking. Othellos ugly, what pleasure could shefind in him? Lovemaking gets boring after a while. To keep thingshot, shell need to see someone with a handsome face,someone close to her in age, someone who looks and acts like her.Othello isnt any of those things. Since hedoesnt have these advantages to make him attractive toher, shell get sick of him until he makes her want topuke. Shell start looking around for a second choice.Now, if thats trueand itsobviously truewhos in a better position thanCassio? Hes a smooth talker, and uses sophistication andfine manners to hide his lust. Nobodys as crafty as heis. Besides, hes young and handsome, and hesgot all the qualities that nave and silly girls go for.Hes a bad boy, and Desdemonas got her eye onhim already.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
I cant believe that. Shes not that kind ofwoman. Shes very moral.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Like hell she is! Shes made of the same flesh andblood as everyone else. If she were so moral, she would never havefallen in love with the Moor in the first place. Good lord! Did younotice how she and Cassio were fondling each othershands? Did you see that?
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Yes, I did. But that wasnt romantic, it was justpolite manners.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
They were lusting after each other. You could tell by how theywere acting that theyre going to be lovers. They were soclose that their breath was mingling. When two people get thatintimate, sex will soon follow. Disgusting! But listen to me; let meguide you. I brought you here from Venice. Be on guard duty tonight.Ill put you in charge. Cassio doesnt knowyou. Ill be nearby. Make Cassio angry somehow, either byspeaking too loud, or insulting his military skills, or however elseyou want.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
All right.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Hes hot-tempered, and he might try to hit you with hisstaff. Try to get him to do that. Thatll allow me tostir up public sentiment against him here in Cyprus. Illget them so riled up that theyll only calm down whenCassios fired. To get what you want, you need to getCassio out of the way. If you dont do that, things arehopeless for you.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Ill do it, if you help me out.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
I promise I will. Meet me in a little while at the citadel. I needto get Othellos things from the ship. Goodbye.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Goodbye.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
I think Cassio really does love her, and its perfectlylikely that she loves him too. I cant stand the Moor,but I have to admit that hes a reliable, loving, andgood-natured man. Hed probably be a good husband toDesdemona. I love her too, not simply out of lust, but also to feedmy revenge. I have a feeling the Moor slept with my wife. Thatthought keeps gnawing at me, eating me up inside. I wontbe satisfied until I get even with him, wife for wife. If Icant do that, I can at least make the Moor so jealousthat he cant think straight. If that piece of Venetiantrash Roderigo can do what I need to carry out my plan,Ill have power over Cassio. Ill say badthings about him to the Moor. I have a feeling Cassio seduced mywife as well. Ill make the Moor thank me, love me, andreward me, even though the joke will be on him the whole time.Ive got a good plan, though I havent workedout the details yet. You can never see the end of an evil plan untilthe moment comes.
</T>
<T>
HERALD
Our noble and courageous general Othello having been informed thatthe Turkish fleet has been completely destroyed, invites every manto celebrate our victory. Some of you dance, some of you makebonfires, and every man celebrate in whatever way he likes to. Forbesides the good news, we are also celebrating his marriage.Thats the end of the announcement. There will be a feastfrom five o'clock until eleven. God bless the island ofCyprus and our noble general Othello!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Good Michael, keep a careful eye on the guards tonight.Lets exercise restraint and not let the party get toowild.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Iago has orders what to do. But Ill see to itpersonally anyway.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Iagos a good man. Goodnight, Michael. Come talk to metomorrow as early as you can.Come with me, my dear love.Now that the weddings over, we can have the pleasure ofconsummating our marriage. Good night, everyone.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Hello, Iago. Its time for us to stand guard.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Not yet, lieutenant. Its not even teno'clock. The general got rid of us early tonight so hecould be with Desdemona.I cant blame him. Hehasnt spent the night with her yet, and shesbeautiful enough to be JovesJove is the head of the gods in Roman mythology.Joves lover.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Shes an exquisitely beautiful lady.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
And I bet shes good in bed too.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Yes, shes young and tender.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
And such pretty eyes! Like an invitation.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Yes, shes pretty. But shes modest andladylike too.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
And when she speaks, doesnt her voice stir up passion?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Shes a perfect woman, its true.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Well, good luck to them tonight in bed! Come with us, lieutenant.Ive got a jug of wine, and these two Cyprus gentlemenwant to drink a toast to the black Othello.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Not tonight, Iago. Im not much of a drinker. I wishthere was less social pressure to drink.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Oh, but these are our friends. Just one glass. Ill domost of the drinking for you.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Ive already had a glass of wine tonight, watered down,but look how drunk I am. Im not a heavy drinker. Iwouldnt dare drink much more than that.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
What are you talking about, man? Tonight is for celebrating! Thegentlemen are waiting.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Where are they?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
By the door. Please invite them in.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Ill do it, but I dont like it.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
If I can just get him to drink one more glass after whathes drunk already, hell be as argumentativeand eager to fight as a little dog. That fool Roderigo, all twistedup inside with love, has been drinking toasts to Desdemona by thegallon, and hes on guard duty.Ive gotten therest of the guards drunk, as well as several gentlemen from Cypruswho are quick to take offense. Now Ill get Cassio to dosomething in front of all these drunkards that will offend everyoneon the island. Here they come. If the future turns out as I hope itwill, Im all set for success.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
My God, theyve given me a lot to drink.
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
No, it was a little one, not more than a pint.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Bring in more wine!
(he sings)
And clink your glasses together,
And clink your glasses together.
A soldiers a man,
And a mans life is short,
So let the soldier drink.
Have some more wine, boys!
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
My God, what a great song!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
I learned it in England, where they have a talent for drinking. TheDanes, the Germans, and the Dutchcome on, drink,drink!are nothing compared to the English.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Are Englishmen really such heavy drinkers?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
They drink Danes under the table, and it takes them no effort atall to out-drink Germans. And the Dutch are vomiting while theEnglish are asking for refills.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Lets drink to our general!
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
Hear, hear! Ill drink as much as you do!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Oh, sweet England!
(he sings)
King Stephen was a good king, and his pants were very cheap,
But he thought his tailor overcharged him, so he called him a peasant.
And that was a man of noble rank, much higher than you are.
So be happy with your worn-out cloak,
Since pride is ruining the nation.
More wine!
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
God, that songs even better than the other one.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Do you want to hear it again?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
No, because we shouldnt be doingthatstuff. Oh well, Gods in charge, and somepeople have to go to heaven, while other people have to go to hell.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Thats true, lieutenant.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Speaking for myselfand no offense to the general oranyone elseI hope Im going to heaven.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Me too, lieutenant.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Okay, but please not before me. The lieutenant has to get toheaven before the ensign. But lets stop this drinkingand get down to business.God forgive oursins!Gentlemen, lets get down to business.By the way, I dont want anyone thinking Imdrunk. This is my ensign. This is my right hand, and this is my lefthand.
Im not drunk. I can stand well enough, and I can speakjust fine.
</T>
<T>
ALL
Yes, youre speaking very well.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Yes, very well. So dont think that Imdrunk.
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
Lets go to the platform where well standguard. Come on.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
You see that man who just left? Hes a good soldier,good enough to be Caesars right-hand man. But he has aserious weakness. Its too bad. Im worriedthat Othello trusts him too much, and itll be bad forCyprus eventually.
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
But is he often like this?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
He drinks like this every night before he goes to sleep.Hed stay up all night and all day if hedidnt drink himself to sleep.
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
The general should be informed about this. Maybe hesnever noticed, or he only wants to see Cassios goodside. Dont you think so?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
(speaking so that only RODERIGO can hear) Hello, Roderigo.Please, follow the lieutenant. Hurry! Go!
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
And its too bad that the Moor chose a man with such adeep-rooted drinking problem as his second-in-command. We shoulddefinitely say something to the Moor.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
I wouldnt say anything, not if you gave me the wholeisland for doing so. I respect Cassio and Id like tohelp cure his alcoholism
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Whats that noise?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Damn you, you villain, you rascal!
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
Whats the matter, lieutenant?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
To think that fool had the nerve to try to teach me manners!Ill beat him until the welts look like basket-weave!
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Youll beat me?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Are you talking, you villain?(hehits RODERIGO)
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
No, dont hit him, lieutenant! Please, sir, restrainyourself. (he restrains CASSIO)
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Let me go, or Ill knock you on the head.
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
Come on, youre drunk.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Drunk?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
(speaking so that only RODERIGO can hear) Go tell everyonetheres a riot.
</T>
<T>
No, lieutenantGod,gentlemenHelpLieutenantsir,MontanoHelp, men!The night guard is coming!
</T>
<T>
Whos sounding that alarm? The whole town will riot!God, lieutenant, please stop! Youll be ashamed of thisforever!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
What is the matter here?
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
My God, Im bleeding! Ive been mortallywounded. Ill kill him!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Stop right now!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Stop! Lieutenantsir, Montanogentlemen!Have you forgotten your duty and your sense of decorum? Stop! Thegeneral is talking to you! Stop, for Gods sake!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
How did this all start? Have we all become as savage as the Turks,treating each other as badly as they would have treated us? Forheavens sake, stop this savage brawl! The next man whoswings his sword must not care about his life, because the instanthe strikes, he dies. Stop that alarm from ringing, itsscaring the islanders. Whats the matter here,gentlemen?Honest Iago, you look upset. Speak up and tellme who started this. Answer me.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
I dont know. We were all having fun until just aminute ago; we were as happy as a bride and groom taking off theirclothes. But then the mood suddenly changed. It was as if somethinghad driven the men insane and made them point their swords at oneanother. I dont
</T>
<T>
know what could have started this. Id rather have lostmy legs in battle than be a part of this!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
How did you manage to lose your self-control like this, Michael?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Please, excuse me, sir. I cant speak.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Montano, youre supposed to be calm and collected.Youre famous for it. Wise people respect you. What inthe world made you risk your reputation like this and become astreet brawler? Tell me.
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
Othello, Ive been seriously hurt. Your officer Iagocan tell you what happened. I should save my breath, since it hurtsto talk. I didnt do anything wrong that I know of,unless it was a sin to defend myself when someone attacked me.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
All right, now Im starting to lose my cool. By God, ifyou dont tell me what happened youll allsuffer. Tell me how this fight began, who started it. Whoever isguilty, even if he were my twin brother, I swear Imthrough with him. Were in a town thats just
</T>
<T>
avoided a war, everyones still on edge, andyoure getting into private fights whileyoure supposed to be on guard duty? Thatsunbelievably bad. Iago, who started it?
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
I know youre close to Cassio, but if you diverge fromthe truth in any way, youre not a true soldier.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Youre hitting close to home there. Idrather cut my tongue out of my mouth than say anything bad aboutMichael Cassio. But I dont think itll hurthim to tell the truth. This is what happened, General. Montano and Iwere talking when a man came running, crying for help. Cassio waschasing him with his sword out, trying to kill the guy. Thisgentleman stopped Cassio and told him to put away his sword. Ifollowed the guy who was crying for help, to keep him from scaringthe public. But he was fast and outran me. When I got back, I heardthe swords clinking and Cassio swearing. Id never heardhim swear before. They were nearly killing each other, as you sawwhen you pulled them apart. I cant tell you anythingelse.
</T>
<T>
But nobodys perfect, and even the best man sometimesloses control and strikes out in rage. Cassio was wrong to hurtMontano, who was only trying to help him, but Im surethe guy who ran away must have offended Cassio in some terrible way,and Cassio couldnt let it pass.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Iago, I know youre fond of Cassio and are downplayingthis for his benefit. Cassio, I love you, but yourenever again going to be one of my officers.
</T>
<T>
Look, youve woken my wife! Ill make you anexample for the others to learn from.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Whats the matter, dear?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Everythings fine, now, sweetheart. Go back tobed. (to MONTANO) Ill see to it personallythat your wounds are treated. Lead him off.
</T>
<T>
Iago, go and calm down the townspeople.Come with me,Desdemona. Unfortunately, its part of thesoldiers life to be woken up by trouble.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Are you hurt, lieutenant?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Yes, but no doctor can help me.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Oh I hope thats not true!
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
My reputation, my reputation! Ive lost my reputation,the longest-living and truest part of myself! Everything else in meis just animal-like. Oh, my reputation, Iago, my reputation!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
I swear I thought you meant youd been hurt physically.Your physical health matters more than your reputation. A reputationis a useless and fake quality that others impose on us. Youhavent lost it unless you think you have. There are lotsof ways to get on the generals good side again.Youve been discharged because hes angry, andbecause hes obliged to do so for policy reasons, notbecause he dislikes you. Hes got to beat up the weak tofrighten the strong. Go to him, petition him. Hellchange his mind.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Id rather ask him to hate me than ask such a goodcommander to accept such a worthless, drunk, stupid officer asmyself. Drunk? Babbling senselessly? Squabbling? Swaggering?Swearing? Ranting and raving to my own shadow! Oh, wine is thedevil!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Who were you chasing with your sword? What did he do to you?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
I dont know.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Is that possible?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
I remember a jumble of impressions, but nothing distinctly. Iremember a fight, but not why we were fighting. Oh God, why do mendrink and lose their minds? Why do we party until werelike animals?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
You seem all right now. How did you get better?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
My drunkenness went away when anger took over. One weakness led toanother, to make me hate myself.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Come on, youre being too hard on yourself. I wish noneof this had happened, given the situation here, and your rank. Butsince this has happened, you should fix it for your own good.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Ill ask him for my position back again, andhell tell me Im a drunk. Even if I had awhole bunch of mouths, I wouldnt be able to answer that.I was a reasonable man, then I became a fool, and finally a beast!Oh, how strange! Every glass of liquor is damned, and thedevils the main ingredient!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Come on now, wine is good for you, if you know how to use it.Dont say anything bad about wine anymore. Lieutenant, Ithink you know Im your friend.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
I know that, sir. Imagine, me, a drunk!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Any man can get drunk sometime. Ill tell you what todo. Othellos wife has a lot of influence now.Hes completely devoted to her. Go open your heart toher. Ask her to help you get back your position. She is so generous,kind, and ready to help that she thinks its wrong not todo everything she can, even more than she is asked to do. Ask her tohelp you heal the rift between her husband and you. Idbet my lucky stars your problem will be forgotten, and yourrelationship will be stronger than ever.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Thats good advice.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Im helping you because I like and respect you.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
I believe it completely. Early in the morning Ill govisit Desdemona and plead my case. My situation is desperate.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Youre doing the right thing. Good night, lieutenant.Ive got to go to the guard tower.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Good night, honest Iago.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Who can say Im evil when my advice is so good?Thats really the best way to win the Moor back again.Its easy to get Desdemona on your side. Shesfull of good intentions. And the Moor loves her so much he wouldrenounce his Christianity to keep her happy. Hes soenslaved by love that she can make him do whatever she wants. How amI evil to advise Cassio to do exactly whatll do himgood? Thats the kind of argument youd expectfrom Satan! When devils are about to commit their biggest sins theyput on their most heavenly faces, just like Im doingnow. And while this fool is begging Desdemona to help him, and whileshes pleading his case to the Moor, Illpoison the Moors ear against her, hinting thatshes taking Cassios side because of her lustfor him. The more she
</T>
<T>
tries to help Cassio, the more shell shakeOthellos confidence in her. And thats howIll turn her good intentions into a big trap to snagthem all.
</T>
<T>
Hello, Roderigo!
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Im totally worn out. My chase is too much for me.Ive spent most of my money, and tonight I got beaten up.The upshot is that Ive got a little more experience. Sowith no money, but a little more wisdom, Im going backto Venice.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Youre a poor man if youre this impatient!If you get hurt, does your wound heal immediately? No, it healsgradually. We achieve things with our intelligence, not by magic,and intelligent planning takes time. Arent things goingwell? Cassios beaten you up, but with that tinysacrifice on your part, you got Cassio discharged! Ifwere patient, well be rewarded with thefruits of our labors. My God, its morning. All thisexcitement has made the time fly by. Go back to whereyoure staying and go to sleep. Go on, Imtelling you. Youll understand better later. Go.
</T>
<T>
Now two things still need to be done. My wife has to help makeDesdemona take Cassios side. Ill put her onthat. And I need to take the Moor aside right at the moment whenCassios talking to Desdemona, so hell seethem together. Yes, thats the way Ill do it.Lets not ruin a brilliant plan by being slow to act.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Musicians, start playing here. Ill pay you for yourtrouble. Play something short that will put the general in a goodmood.
</T>
<T>
CLOWN
Your instruments all have a nasal twang. Have they been to NaplesNaples was considered a likely place to contract syphilis, which eats away at the bridge of the nose.Naples?
</T>
<T>
MUSICIAN
Excuse me?
</T>
<T>
CLOWN
Are these wind instruments?
</T>
<T>
MUSICIAN
Yes, they are.
</T>
<T>
CLOWN
Oh, theres the problem.
</T>
<T>
MUSICIAN
Whats the problem?
</T>
<T>
CLOWN
Anyone full of hot air is a problem. But heres somemoney. The general likes your music a lot, but he asks you to stopplaying now.
</T>
<T>
MUSICIAN
Well, well stop, then.
</T>
<T>
CLOWN
If youve got any music that cant be heard,then play that. But as I said, the general isnt reallyin the mood to hear music now.
</T>
<T>
MUSICIAN
We dont have any music that cant be heard.
</T>
<T>
CLOWN
Then pack up your instruments and go away. Go!
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Do you hear, my friend?
</T>
<T>
CLOWN
No, I dont hear your friend. I hear you.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Please dont play games. (CASSIO gives CLOWN money).Theres a bit of gold for you. When the woman taking careof the generals wife wakes up, could you please tell herthat Cassio asks to speak with her?
</T>
<T>
CLOWN
Shes awake, sir. If she feels like coming over here,Ill give her your message.
</T>
<T>
Good to see you, Iago.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
You didnt go to sleep, then?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
No. When I left you it was already morning. Ive beenbold, Iago. Ive asked to talk to your wife.Im going to ask her to let me talk to Desdemona.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Ill send her out to you now. Ill think of a plan to get the Moor out of the way, so you can speak more openly.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
I humbly thank you.
</T>
<T>
Even for a FlorentineThe citizens of Florence (who included Machiavelli) were not known for kindness and honesty, but Michael Cassio seems unaware of Florences bad reputation.Florentine, I never knew someone so kind and honest.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Good morning, lieutenant. Im sorry about what happened, but Im sure everything will turn out all right. The general and his wife are talking about it now, and shes defending you strongly. The Moor says the man you hurt is very important in Cyprus, and that under the circumstances he has no choice but to refuse to reinstate you. But he says he still loves and respects you, and based on his own feelings alone hes looking for an opportunity to safely take you back.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Please find a way to give me some time alone with Desdemona, if you think thats all right.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Please come in. Ill take you to a place where you can speak freely.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Thank you very much.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Iago, give these letters to the ships captain who brought me here, and ask him to pay my respects to the Senate of Venice. Now thats done, Im going to walk on the fortification walls. Look for me there when you come back.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
I will, my lord.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Shall we go see this fortification, men?
</T>
<T>
GENTLEMEN
Were at your service, my lord.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Ill do everything I can for you, Cassio.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Please do, madam. My husbands so upset about Cassios problem youd think it was his own.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Your husbands such a good man. Dont worry, Cassio. Im sure you and my husband will be as friendly as you were before.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
My dear beautiful lady, whatever happens to Michael Cassio, hell always be your humble servant.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
I know that. Thank you. Youre my husbands friend and youve known him a long time. I assure you the only reason hes keeping away from you now is political.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Yes, my lady. But those political considerations might last such a long time that the general will forget my love and service, especially if Im gone and someone else has my job.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Thatll never happen. Emilia here will be my witness: I promise you that youll get your position back again. And if I promise to help someone, I do everything I can. My husband will never get a moments rest, Ill keep him up at night talking about you until he runs out
</T>
<T>
of patience. He will think that his bed has become a conference table for discussing your problemhe wont be able to get away from it. Ill bring up your name at every moment. So cheer up. Im your advocate, and Id rather die than give up on you.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Madam, here comes your husband.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Madam, Id better leave now.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Why not stay and hear me talk to him?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
No, madam. Im very uncomfortable, and that wont help my case.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Well, do whatever you think best.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Hey! I dont like that.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
What did you say?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Nothing, my lord, or if I didI dont know what.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Wasnt that Cassio leaving my wife?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Cassio, my lord? No, I dont think so. He wouldnt sneak away looking so guilty when he saw you coming.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
I really think it was him.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Whats this, my lord? I was talking to a petitioner here just now, someone whos suffering from your anger.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Who do you mean?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Your lieutenant, Cassio. Oh, if Ive got any influence over you at all, please patch things up with him. In my judgment, this man truly loves you, and his mistake was innocent rather than wicked. Please call him and tell him to come back here.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Was that him just now?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Yes. He feels so bad and humble that I feel bad along with him. My love, call him back in here.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Not now, my sweet Desdemona. Some other time.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
But will it be soon?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Very soon, because you want it.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Will it be tonight at supper?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
No, not tonight.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Then tomorrow at dinner?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
I wont be eating dinner at home. Ill be meeting the captains at the citadel.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Well then, tomorrow night, or Tuesday morning. Or Tuesday noon or at night, or Wednesday morning. Please just name a time, but dont wait more than three days. Hes very sorry. His mistake was hardly worth punishing him for in the first placethough in wartime it is sometimes necessary to make examples out of even the best soldiers. So when should he come? Tell me, Othello. I cant imagine you asking me for something and me telling you no or standing there muttering. Michael Cassio came with you when you were trying to win my love. Sometimes Id criticize you to him, and hed defend you. And now I have to make this big fuss about bringing him back? I swear, I could do so much
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Please, no more. He can come whenever he wants. I wont refuse you anything.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Dont act like youre doing me a favor! This is like if I asked you to wear your gloves when its cold outside, or eat nutritious food, or do something thats good for you. If I ever have to ask you for something that will put your luck to the test, itll be something difficult and terrible.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
I wont deny you anything! But in return, please, do one thing for me: leave me alone for a little while.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Would I ever deny you anything? No. Goodbye, my husband.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Goodbye, my Desdemona. Ill come see you right away.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Come here, Emilia.Do whatever you feel like doing, my husband, and Ill obey you.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
What a wonderful girl! God help me, I love you! And when I stop loving you, the universe will fall back into the chaos that was there when time began.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
My noble lord
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
What is it, Iago?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
When you were wooing Desdemona, did Michael Cassio know about it?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Yes, he knew about it the whole time. Why do you ask?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
I was just curious. No reason.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Why are you curious, Iago?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
I didnt realize he knew her.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Oh, yes. He carried messages back and forth between us very often.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Oh, really?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Oh, really? Yes, really. Do you see something wrong with that? Isnt he an honest man?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Honest, my lord?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Honest, yes, honest.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
As far as I know, sir.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
What are you thinking?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Thinking, my lord?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Thinking, my lord? My God, you keep repeating everything I say as if you were thinking something too horrible to say out loud. Youre thinking something. Just a minute ago I heard you say you didnt like it when Cassio left my wife. What didnt you like? And when I told you he was involved the whole time I was trying to get Desdemona, you were like, Oh, really? And then you frowned and wrinkled up your forehead as if you were imagining something horrible. If youre my friend, tell me what youre thinking.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
My lord, you know Im your friend.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
I think you are. And I know youre full of love and honesty, and you think carefully before you speak. Thats why these pauses of yours frighten me. If some fool were withholding things from me, I wouldnt think twice about it. If some lying, cheating villain acted like that, it would just be a trick. But when an honest man acts like that, you know hes wrestling with bad thoughts and cant help it.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
As for Michael Cassio, I think it would be safe for me to swear that hes honest.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
I think so too.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
People should be what they appear to be. If theyre not honest, they shouldnt look like they are!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Absolutely, people should be what they appear to be.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
In that case, I think Cassios an honest man.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
No, I think theres more to this than youre letting on. Please tell me what youre thinkingeven your worst suspicions.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Please dont make me do that, sir. I have to obey all your orders, but surely Im not obligated to reveal my deepest thoughtseven slaves arent expected to do that. You want me to say what Im thinking? What if my thoughts are disgusting and wrong? Even good people think horrible things sometimes. Who is so pure that they never think a bad thought?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Youre not being a good friend, Iago, if you even think your friend has been wronged and you dont tell him about it.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Please dont ask me to tell you. I might be completely wrong. I have a bad tendency to be suspicious of people and to look too closely into what theyre doing. Often I imagine crimes that arent really there. You would be wise to ignore my weak guesses and imaginary suspicions, and dont worry yourself about the meaningless things Ive noticed. For me to tell you my thoughts would only destroy your peace of mind, and
</T>
<T>
it wouldnt be wise, honest, or responsible for me to tell them.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
What are you talking about?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
A good reputation is the most valuable thing we havemen and women alike. If you steal my money, youre just stealing trash. Its something, its nothing: its yours, its mine, and itll belong to thousands more. But if you steal my reputation, youre robbing me of something that doesnt make you richer, but makes me much poorer.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Im going to find out what youre thinking.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
You cant find that out, even if you held my heart in your hand you couldnt make me tell you. And as long my hearts inside my body, you never will.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
What?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Beware of jealousy, my lord! Its a green-eyed monster that makes fun of the victims it devours. The man who knows his wife is cheating on him is happy, because at least he isnt friends with the man shes sleeping with. But think of the unhappiness of a man who worships his wife, yet doubts her faithfulness. He suspects her, but still loves her.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Oh, what misery!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
The person whos poor and contented is rich enough. But infinite riches are nothing to someone whos always afraid hell be poor. God, help us not be jealous!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Why are you telling me this? Do you think I would live a life of jealousy, tormented by new suspicions every hour? No. If theres any doubt, there is no doubt. I might as well be a goat if I ever let myself become obsessed with the kind of suspicions youre implying. If you say my wife is beautiful, eats well, loves good company, speaks freely, sings, plays music, and dances well, youre not making me jealous. When a woman is virtuous, talents like these just make her better. And Im not going to start feeling inferior. She had her eyes wide open when she chose me. No, Iago, Ill have to see some real evidence before I start suspecting her of anything bad, and when I suspect her, Ill look for proof, and if theres proof, thats when Ill let go of my love and my jealousy.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Im glad to hear you say that. Now I can show you my devotion and my duty with more honesty. So please listen to me. Im not talking about proof yet. Watch your wife. Watch how she is with Cassio. Just watchdont be either completely suspicious or completely trustful. I wouldnt want to see you taken advantage of because youre such an open and trusting guy. Watch out! I know the people of Venice well. They let God see things they wouldnt show their husbands. They dont avoid doing things that are wrong, they just try not to get caught.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Do you really think so?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
She lied to her father to marry you. And when she pretended to be afraid of you, she loved you the most.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Thats right, she did.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Well, there you go. She was so young, but she deceived her father so thoroughly he thought it was witchcraft! But Im sorry Ive blurted all this out. I beg your pardon for loving you too much.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Im indebted to you forever.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
You seem a little depressed about this.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Not at all, not at all.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Really, Im afraid you are. I hope you remember that I said all this because I love you. But I see youre troubled. Please dont take what I said more seriously than it deserves to be taken.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
I wont.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
If you take it too seriously, itll have bad effects that I didnt want it to have. Cassios a good friend of mineMy lord, I can see youre upset.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
No, not too upset. Im sure Desdemona would never cheat on me.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
I hope she never does! And I hope you keep on thinking she wouldnt.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
But still, its true that good things can go bad, away from their true natures
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Thats the point Im trying to make. If I can be frank with you, she veered away from her own nature in turning down all those young men from her own country, with her skin color, with her statuseverything her nature would have drawn her toUgh! You can almost smell the dark and ugly desires inside her, the unnatural thoughtsButIm sorryI didnt mean to refer to her specifically just now. I only worry that she might snap back to her natural taste in men one day, and compare you unfavorably to other Italians.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Goodbye, goodbye. If you see anything else, let me know. Tell your wife to watch her. Leave me alone now, Iago.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
My lord, Ill say goodbye now. (beginning to exit)
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
(to himself) Why did I ever get married? Im sure this good and honest man sees and knows more, much more, than hes telling me.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
(returning) My lord, please dont think about this any more. Time will tell. Its right for Cassio to have his lieutenancy backhes very talented. But keep him away for a while, and youll see how he goes about getting it back. Notice whether your wife insists on your
</T>
<T>
giving it back to him. That will tell you a lot. But in the meantime, just assume that Im paranoidas Im pretty sure I amand keep thinking shes innocent, please.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Dont worry about how I handle it.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Ill say goodbye once more.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
This Iago is extremely honest and good, and he knows a lot about human behavior. If it turns out that she really is running around on me, Ill send her away, even though itll break my heart. Maybe because Im black, and I dont have nice manners like courtiers do, or because Im getting oldbut thats not muchShes gone, and Ive been cheated on. I have no choice but to hate her. Oh what a curse marriage is! We think our beautiful wives belong to us, but their desires are free! Id rather be a toad in a moldy basement than to have only a part of someone I love, sharing the rest of her with others. This is the plague of important menour wives betray us more than those of poor men. Its our destiny, like death. We are destined to be betrayed when we are born. Oh, here she comes.
</T>
<T>
If shes cheated on me, then heaven itself is a fake. I dont believe it.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Whats going on, Othello, darling? The nobles of Cyprus whom you invited to dinner are waiting for you.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Im sorry.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Why are you whispering? Are you sick?
</T>

OTHELLO
I have a headacheIn Shakespeare\s day, cuckolds, or men whose wives cheated on them, were imagined to have horns growing from their heads. Othello is alluding to this.headache, right here in my forehead.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Thats from lack of sleep. Itll go away. Let me wrap up your head, and it will feel okay in less than an hour. (she pulls out a handkerchief)
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
No, your handkerchiefs too little. Leave my head alone.
</T>
<T>
Come on, Ill escort you to dinner.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Im very sorry youre not feeling well.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
(picking up the handkerchief) Im glad I found this handkerchief. Its the first keepsake the Moor gave her. My stubborn husband has asked me to steal it a
</T>
<T>
hundred times. But she loves it so much (since Othello told her she should always keep it with her) that she always keeps it near her to kiss it and talk to it. Ill copy the embroidery pattern and then give it to Iago. Heaven knows what hes going to do with it. I only try to satisfy his whims.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Whats going on? What are you doing here alone?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Dont snap at me. Ive got something for you.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Youve got something for me? Its a common thingThing was slang for vagina. By saying that Emilia\s thing is common, Iago implies that she lets anyone have sex with herthing
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
What?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
to have a stupid wife.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Oh, is that so? And what would you give me for the handkerchief?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
What handkerchief?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
What handkerchief? The one the Moor gave to Desdemona, which you asked me to steal so many times.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
You stole it from her?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
No, actually. She dropped it carelessly, and, seizing the opportunity, since I was here, I picked it up. Look, here it is.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Good girl, give it to me.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
And what are you going to do with it? Why did you want it so much that you begged me to steal it?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Whats it to you?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
If you dont need it for some important reason, then give it back to me. Poor lady, shell go crazy when she sees its missing.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Dont admit to knowing anything about it. I need it. Now go, leave me.
</T>
<T>
Ill leave this handkerchief at Cassios house and let him find it.To a jealous man, a meaningless little thing like this looks like absolute proof. This handkerchief may be useful to me. The Moors mind has already become infected with my poisonous suggestions. Ideas can be like poisons. At first they hardly even taste bad, but once they get into your blood they start burning like hot lava.
</T>
<T>
Here he comes. No drugs or sleeping pills will ever give you the restful sleep that you had last night.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Argh! Shes cheating on me?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Oh, general, please, no more of that!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Get lost! Youve tortured me with these thoughts. It is better to be tricked completely than to only suspect a little.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Whats with you, my lord?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
I had no idea she was cheating on me. I never saw it or suspected it, so it never hurt me. I slept well, ate well, and was happy. I never saw Cassios kisses on her lips. A man whos robbed, but doesnt miss whats stolen, isnt robbed at all.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Im sorry to hear this.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
I wouldve been happy if the whole army had had sex with her, the lowest-ranking grunts and all, as long as I didnt know anything about it. Oh, goodbye to my peace of mind! Goodbye to my happiness! Goodbye to the soldiers and to the wars that make men great! Goodbye! Goodbye to the horses and the trumpets and the drums, the flute and the splendid banners, and all those proud displays and pageantry of war! And you deadly cannons that roar like thunderbolts thrown by the gods, goodbye! Othellos career is over.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Is this possible, my lord?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
You villain, youd better be able to prove my wifes a whore! Be sure of it. Get me proof I can see. If you cant, trust me, you wont want to feel my rage!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Has it come to this?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Show me, or at least prove it beyond the shadow of a doubt. If you cant, your life is worthless!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
My noble lord
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
If youre slandering her just to torture me, then itll be no use to pray for mercy or say youre sorry. You might as well go ahead and commit every unspeakable crime you can think of, because theres nothing you could that would top what youve already done!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Oh, heaven help me! Arent you a rational human being? Dont you have any sense at all? Goodbye. I resign my official position. Im such an idiot for always telling the truth! What a horrible world we live in! Listen, pay attention, everybody. Its not safe to be straightforward and honest. Im glad youve taught me this valuable lesson. From now on, Ill never try to help a friend when it hurts him so much to hear the truth.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
No, stop. You should always be honest.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
I should always be wise. Honestys stupid, it makes me lose my friends even when Im trying to help them.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
I swear, I think my wifes faithful, and I think shes not. I think youre trustworthy one minute and then not the next. I need proof! Her reputation was as pure as the snow, but now its as dirty and black as my own face. As long as there are ropes, knives, poison, fire, or streams to drown inBy referring to instruments of death, Othello implies that he wants to commit either suicide or murderropes, knives, poison, fire, or streams to drown in , I wont stand for this. Oh, how I wish I knew the truth!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
I see youre all eaten up with emotion. Im sorry I said anything. You want proof?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Want? Yes, I want it, and Ill get it.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
But how? How will you get proof? Are you going to hide and watch them having sex?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Death and damnation! Oh!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
I think it would be very hard to arrange for them to have sex while you watched. If anyone sees them in bed together besides themselves, I guess we could damn them then. So what can we do? What can I say? What proof is there? Itd be impossible for you to watch them, even if they were as horny as animals in heat and as stupid as drunks. But if you would be willing to accept circumstantial evidence as proof, we can get that.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Give me one good reason to think shes cheating on me.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
I dont like what youre asking me to do. But since Ive gotten myself involved this far, because Im so stupidly honest and because I like you so much, Ill keep going. I recently shared a bed with Cassio, and I couldnt sleep because of a raging toothache. Well, some people talk in their sleep, and Cassio is one of them. I heard him saying, Sweet Desdemona, lets be careful and hide our love, in his sleep. And then he grabbed my hand and said, Oh, my darling! and
</T>
<T>
kissed me hard, as if he were trying to suck my lips off. Then he put his leg over mine, and sighed and kissed me, and said, Damn fate for giving you to the Moor!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Oh, thats monstrous! Monstrous!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
No, it was just a dream.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
But it shows that something has already happened.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Its a reason for suspicion, even though its just a dream. And it might back up other evidence that may seem too flimsy.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Ill tear her to pieces!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
No, be reasonable. We dont have any proof yet. She might still be faithful. Just tell me this: have you ever seen her holding a handkerchief with an embroidered strawberry pattern on it?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Yes, I gave her one like that. It was my first gift to her.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
I dont know about that, but I saw a handkerchief like that today. Im sure it belongs to your wife, and I saw Cassio use it to wipe his beard.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
If its the same one
</T>
<T>
IAGO
If its the same one, or any one that belongs to her, then together with the other evidence its pretty strong.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Oh, Id kill that bastard Cassio forty thousand times if I could! Killing him once is not enough revenge. Now I see its true. Oh, Iago, all the love I felt is gone, vanished in the wind. Welcome, hatred and vengeance! Get out of my heart, love! My heart feels like its full of poisonous snakes!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Calm down
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
I want blood!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Be patient, Im telling you. You may change your mind later.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Never, Iago. My thoughts of revenge are flowing through me like a violent river, never turning back to love, only flowing toward full revenge thatll swallow them up. I swear to God Ill get revenge. (he kneels)
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Dont get up yet. Let heaven be my witnessIm putting my mind, my heart, and my hands in Othellos control. Let him command me, and Ill do whatever he asks, no matter how violent.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
I accept your devotion with my deepest love. Ill put you to the test right away. Within the next three days I want to hear you tell me that Cassios dead.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
My friend Cassio is dead. Its done, because you request it. But let her live.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Damn her, the wicked whore! Oh, damn her, damn her! Come away with me. Im going inside to think up some way to kill that beautiful devil. Youre my lieutenant now.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Im yours forever.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Excuse me, do you know which room Lieutenant Cassio lies inlies in = sleeps inlies in?
</T>
<T>
CLOWN
I wouldnt dare say he lies anywhere.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Why do you say that?
</T>
<T>
CLOWN
Hes a soldier. If I accused a soldier of lying, hed stab me.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Oh, come on. Where does he sleep?
</T>
<T>
CLOWN
Telling you where hes sleeping is like telling you where Im lying.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
What on earth does that mean?
</T>
<T>
CLOWN
I dont know where hes staying, so if I told you hes sleeping here or there, Id be lying.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Can you ask around and find out?
</T>
<T>
CLOWN
Ill go ask questions everywhere.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Find him and tell him to come here. Tell him Ive spoken to my husband on his behalf, and I think everything will be all right.
</T>
<T>
CLOWN
I think I can do that. Its not too much to ask.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Where could I have lost that handkerchief, Emilia?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
I dont know, madam.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Believe me, Id rather have lost a purse full of gold coins. This would be enough to make my husband suspect me, if he wasnt so free of jealousy.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Hes not jealous?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Who, him? I think all tendencies to jealousy were burned out of him by the sun of his native land.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Look, here he comes.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
I wont leave him alone until he gives Cassio his job back.How are you, my lord?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Im fine, my lady.(to himself) Oh, its so hard to pretend!How are you, Desdemona?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Im fine, my lord.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Give me your handMoist hands were supposed to indicate a tendency toward love.hand. Your hands moist, my lady.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Its moist because its still young and inexperienced.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
It says youre fertile, and youve got a giving heart. Hot, hot and moist. With a hand like this you need to
</T>
<T>
fast and pray to stave off temptations. Someone with a young sweating hand like this one is bound to act up sooner or later. Its a nice hand, an open one.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Youre right to say that. This was the hand that gave you my heart.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
This hand gives itself away very freely. In the old days, people used to give their hearts to each other when they joined their hands in marriage. But these days, people give each other their hands without their hearts.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
I dont know about that. Now, dont forget, you promised me something.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
What did I promise, my dear?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
I sent for Cassio to come talk with you.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
I have a bad cold thats bothering me. Lend me your handkerchief.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Here, my lord.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
No, the one I gave you.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
I dont have it with me.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
You dont?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
No, my lord.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Thats not good. An Egyptian woman gave that handkerchief to my mother. She was a witch, and she could
</T>
<T>
almost read peoples thoughts. She told my mother that as long as she kept it with her, my father would love and desire her. But if she lost it or gave it away, my father would start hating her and looking at other women. When she was dying she gave it to me and told me to give it to my wife when I got married. I did. So pay attention. Treat it as something precious. Losing it or giving it away would be an unspeakable loss, a loss like none other.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Is that possible?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Yes, its true. Theres magic in its fabric. A two-hundred-year-old witch sewed it while she was in a fevered trance. The silk came from sacred silkworms, and it was dyed with fluid made from embalmed virgins' hearts.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Really? Is that true?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Its absolutely true, so take good care of it.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
I wish I had never seen it!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Ha! Why?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Why are you yelling at me so angrily?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Is it lost? Is it gone? Tell me, is it missing?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
God help me!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
What do you have to say for yourself?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Its not lost, but what if it were?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
What do you mean?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Im telling you, its not lost.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Then bring it here. Let me see it.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
I could, sir. But I dont want to now. This is just a trick to take my mind off what Im asking you for. Please hire Cassio again.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Bring me the handkerchiefMy mind is full of doubt.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Come on. You know youll never find a more capable man.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
The handkerchief!
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Hes counted on your friendship for his success. Hes shared dangers with you
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
The handkerchief!
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Really, I dont think youre behaving very well.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Damn it!
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
And you say hes not jealous?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
I never saw him like this before. There must be some magic in that handkerchief. Im miserable that I lost it.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Men are all the same, but it takes longer than a year or two to see how bad they are. Theyre like stomachs and were just the food. They eat us up hungrily, and when theyre full, they vomit us up. Look, here comes Cassio and my husband.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Theres no other way. Shes the one whos got to do it. And what luck, shes here! Go ahead and ask her.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Hello, Cassio. How are you?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Nothing, madam. Just my earlier request. Im begging you to help me get back on his good side. Im devoted to him with all my heart. I cant wait any longer. If my wrongdoing was so serious that I cant get back into his good graces either by my past service, or my present situation, or the promise of devoted service in the future, just knowing that would help me. Then I could stop wondering, and find some other career.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Im sorry, dear Cassio, but now is not the right time to bring up your case. My husbands not himself. If his face changed as much as his personality has, I wouldnt recognize him. God knows I have done my best to argue for you, and made him angry at me for being so aggressive. Youll just have to be patient for a little while. Ill do what I can, more than Id do for myself. Let that be enough for you.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Is Othello angry?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
He just left, clearly upset about something.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Can he even get angry? Its hard to believe. Ive seen him stay calm when cannons were blowing his soldiers to bits, even killing his own brother without him batting an eyelidis he really upset? It must be about something important. Ill go talk to him. If hes angry, there must be something seriously wrong.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Please, do so.
</T>
<T>
There must be some political news from Venice, or some dangerous plot here in Cyprus has ruined his good mood. Men always get angry about little things when theyre really worried about bigger ones. Thats the way it goes. When our finger hurts, it makes the rest of the body hurt too. We shouldnt expect men to be perfect, or for them to be as polite as on the weddingday. Oh, Emilia, Im so inexperienced that I thought he was being unkind, but actually I was judging him harshly.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
I hope to God its something political, like you think, and not jealousy involving you.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Oh no! I never gave him reason to be jealous.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
But jealous people dont think like that. Theyre never jealous for a reason; theyre just jealous. Its like a monster that just grows and grows, out of nothing.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
I hope God keeps that monster from growing in Othellos mind!
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Amen to that, lady.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Ill go look for himCassio, stay around here. If hes in a good mood Ill mention you again, and do everything I can.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
I thank you, lady.
</T>
<T>
BIANCA
Hello, Cassio!
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Why are you so far from home? How are you, my pretty Bianca? To tell you the truth, I was just going to your house.
</T>
<T>
BIANCA
And I was just going to yours. Youve kept away from me for a week? Seven days and seven nights? A hundred and sixty-eight hours? And lovers' hours are a hundred and sixty times longer than normal ones! What a tedious wait!
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Im sorry, Bianca. All this time Ive been depressed and had problems on my mind. When I get some free time Ill make it up to you. (he gives her DESDEMONA s handkerchief) Sweet Bianca, would you copy this embroidery pattern for me?
</T>
<T>
BIANCA
Oh, Cassio, where did you get this? This is a gift from another woman, a new lover! Now I know why youve been staying away from me. Has it come to this? Well, well.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Oh, come on, woman. Stop jumping to silly conclusions. Now youre jealous, thinking that this is from some mistress of mine, but I swear its not, Bianca.
</T>
<T>
BIANCA
Well, whose is it?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
I dont even know. I found it in my room. Its pretty. Someone is certainly looking for it, and Ill have to give it back. So Id like it copied. Take it and do that for me, and leave me alone for a while.
</T>
<T>
BIANCA
Leave you alone! Why?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Im waiting here for the general, and I dont want him to see me with a woman.
</T>
<T>
BIANCA
And whys that?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Its not because I dont love you.
</T>
<T>
BIANCA
But you dont love me. Please, just walk with me a little ways, and tell me if Ill see you later tonight.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
I can only walk a little way with you, since Im waiting here. But Ill see you soon.
</T>
<T>
BIANCA
All right, have it your way. I have to make do.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Do you really think so?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
What do you mean, do I think so?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
What, just because they kissed in private?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
An illicit kiss!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Maybe she was just naked in bed with him for an hour or so, but they didnt do anything.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Naked in bed together, but without doing anything? Come on, Iago. That would be like playing a trick on the devil: theyd make him think theyre going to commit adultery, but then back off. Anyone who acted like that would be letting the devil tempt them, and tempting God to condemn them.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
As long as they didnt do anything, it would only be a minor sin. But if I gave my wife a handkerchief
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Then what?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Then its hers. And if its hers, I guess she can give it to any man she wants.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Her reputation is also her own. Can she give that away too?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
You cant see a reputation. A lot of people dont even deserve the reputations they have. But a handkerchief
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
God, I wish I could forget about the handkerchief! What you told me it haunts me like a nightmarehes got my handkerchief!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Yes, what about it?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Thats not good.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
What if Id said I saw him do something to hurt you? Or heard him say something about it. You know there are jerks out there who have to brag about bedding some woman.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Has he said anything?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Yes, but hed deny it all.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
What did he say?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
He said he didI dont know.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
He what?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
He was in bed with
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
With her?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
With her, on top of herhowever you want to say it.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
In bed with her? On top of her? I would have thought people were telling lies about her rather than believe he was lying on her. My God, its nauseating! Handkerchiefconfessionshandkerchief! Ill kill him first, and then let him confessIm trembling with rage. I wouldnt be trembling like this if I didnt know deep down this was all true. Noses, ears, lips. Is it possible? Tell me the truthHandkerchiefDamn it!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Keep working, poison! This is the way to trick gullible fools. Many good and innocent women are punished for reasons like this.My lord? My lord, Othello!
</T>
<T>
Hey, Cassio!
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Whats the matter?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Othellos having some kind of epileptic fit. This is his second fit like this. He had one yesterday.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Rub his temples.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
No, dont. This fit has to run its course. If you interrupt it, hell foam at the mouth and go crazy. Look, hes moving. Why dont you go away for a bit? Hell get
</T>
<T>
better right away. When he leaves, its very important that I talk to you.
</T>
<T>
What happened, general? Did you hit your head?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Are you making fun of me?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Making fun of you? No, I swear! I wish you could face your bad news like a man!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
A man whos been cheated on isnt a real man. Hes subhuman, like an animal.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
In that case there are a lot of animals on the loose in this city.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Did he confess?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Sir, be a man. Every married man has been cheated on. Millions of men sleep with wives who cheat on them, wrongly believing they belong to them alone. Your case is better than that. At least youre not ignorant. The worst thing of all is to kiss your wife thinking shes innocent, when in fact shes a whore. No, Id rather know the truth. Then Ill know exactly what she is, just as I know what I am.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Youre wise! Thats for sure.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Go somewhere else for a while. Calm down. While you were dazed by griefwhich isnt appropriate for a man like youCassio showed up here. I got him to leave, and made up an excuse for your trance. I told him to come back and talk to me in a bit, and he promised he would. So hide here and watch how he sneers
</T>
<T>
at you. Ill make him tell me the whole story againwhere, how often, how long agoand when he plans to sleep with your wife in the future. Im telling you, just watch his face. But stay calm, and dont get carried away by rage, or Ill think youre not a man.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Do you hear what Im saying, Iago? Ill be very patient, butdo you hear me?Im not done with him yet
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Thats fine, but for now keep your cool. Will you go hide?
</T>
<T>
Now Ill ask Cassio about Bianca, a prostitute who sells her body for food and clothes. Shes crazy about Cassio. Thats the whores curse, to seduce many men, but to be seduced by one. Whenever he talks about her he cant stop laughing.
</T>
<T>
And when he laughs, Othello will go crazy. In his ignorant jealousy, hell totally misunderstand Cassios smiles, gestures, and jokes.How are you, lieutenant?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
It doesnt make me feel any better when you call me lieutenant. Im dying to have that title back again.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Just keep asking Desdemona, and itll be yours. If it was up to Bianca to get you your job back, youd have had it already!
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
The poor thing!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Hes laughing already!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
I never knew a woman who loved a man so much.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
The poor thing, I really think she loves me.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Now he denies it a bit, and tries to laugh it off.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Have you heard this, Cassio?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Hes asking him to tell the story again. Go on, tell it.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
She says youre going to marry her. Are you?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Ha, ha, ha!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Are you laughing because youve won? Do you think youve won?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Me, marry her? That whore? Please give me a little credit! Im not that stupid. Ha, ha, ha!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
So, so, so, so! The winners always got the last laugh, hasnt he?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
I swear, theres a rumor going around that youll marry her.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Youre kidding!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
If its not true, you can call me a villain.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Have you given me bastard children to raise? All right, then.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
The little monkey must have started that rumor herself. She thinks Ill marry her because she loves me. Shes just flattering herself. I never promised her anything.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Iago is gesturing for me to come closer. Now hes telling the story.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
She was here just now. She hangs around me all the time. I was talking to some Venetians down by the shore, and the fool showed up. I swear to you, she put her arms around me like this
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Saying, Oh, Cassio, it seems, judging by his gestures.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
She hangs around me and dangles from my neck and cries, shaking me and pulling at me. Ha, ha, ha!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Now hes saying how she took him into our bedroom. Oh, I can see your nose now. But I cant see the dog Im going to throw it to.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
I have to get rid of her.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Look out, here she comes.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Its a whore like all the others, stinking of cheap perfume.Why are you always hanging around me?
</T>
<T>
BIANCA
Damn you! What did you mean by giving me this handkerchief? I was an idiot to take it! You want me to copy the embroidery pattern? That was a likely story, that you found it in your room and didnt know who it belonged to. This is a love token from some other slut, and you want me to copy its pattern for you? Give it back to her, I wont do anything with it.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
What is it, my dear Bianca? Whats wrong?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
My God, thats my handkerchief!
</T>
<T>
BIANCA
If you want to come have dinner with me, you can. If you dont want to, then good riddance.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Go after her, go.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Actually, I should. Shell scream in the streets if I dont.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Will you be having dinner with her tonight?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Yes, I will.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Well, maybe Ill see you there. Id really like to speak with you.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Please come. Will you?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Dont talk anymore, go after her.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
(coming forward) How should I murder him, Iago?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Did you see how he laughed about sleeping with her?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Oh Iago!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
And did you see the handkerchief?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Was it mine?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
It was yours, I swear. And do you see how much your foolish wife means to him? She gave it to him, and he gave it to his whore.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
I wish I could keep killing him for nine years straight. Oh, shes a fine woman! A fair woman! A sweet woman!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
No, you have to forget all that now.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Yes, let her die and rot and go to hell tonight. She wont stay alive for long. No, my hearts turned to stonewhen I hit it, it hurts my hand. Oh, the world never saw a sweeter creature. She could be married to an emperor, and hed be like her slave!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
But thats not how youre going to be.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Damn her, Im just describing her truthfully! Shes so good at sewing, and a wonderful musician. Oh, she could sing a wild bear to sleep! Oh, shes so witty and creative!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
All the worse that she stooped this low, then.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Oh, a thousand times worse, a thousand timesand what a sweet personality she has!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Yes, a little too sweet.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Yes, thats for sure. Oh, its dreadful, dreadful, Iago!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
If you still feel so affectionate toward her, then why not give her permission to cheat on you? If it doesnt bother you, it wont bother anyone else.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Ill chop her into pieces. How could she cheat on me?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Oh, its horrible of her.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
And with my own officer!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Thats worse.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Get me some poison tonight, Iago. I wont argue with her, so her beautiful body wont disarm me.Tonight, Iago.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Dont do it with poison. Strangle her in her bed, the same bed shes contaminated.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Good, good, I like thatits only fair! Very good!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
And let me kill Cassio. Youll hear more from me by midnight.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Excellent, good.
</T>
<T>
Whats that trumpet for?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
I think someones coming from Venice. Its Lodovico. He must be coming from the duke. Look, your wife is with him.
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
Greetings, good general!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Greetings, sir.
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
The duke and senators of Venice greet you.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Ill do whatever they order me to do in this letter.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Whats new, cousin Lodovico?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Very nice to see you, sir. Welcome to Cyprus.
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
Thank you. How is lieutenant Cassio?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Well, hes alive.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Cousin, theres been a falling out between him and Othello. An unfortunate rift, but you can fix it.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Are you sure of that?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Excuse me?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
(reading) Dont fail to do this, since youll
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
He didnt say anything, hes reading. So theres a rift between Othello and Cassio?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Yes, unfortunately. Id do anything to bring them back together, since I really care for Cassio.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Damn it all!
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Excuse me, my lord?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Are you in your right mind?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Is he angry?
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
Maybe the letter upset him. I think they want him to go home and appoint Cassio governor in his place.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Im happy about that.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Oh, are you really!
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
My lord?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Im glad youre insane enough to admit it in front of me.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Why, sweet Othello
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
(striking her) You devil!
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
I havent done anything to deserve this!
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
My lord, no one will believe this in Venice, even though Id swear I saw it with my own eyes. That was too much. You should apologize. Shes crying.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Oh, you devil, you devil! You can cry all day and all night, and I still wont believe youre sad. Get out of my sight!
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
I wouldnt want to stay here and make you angry.
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
Shes obedienta fine lady. Please, my lord, call her back.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Madam!
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
My lord?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
What do you want with her, sir?
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
Who, me?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Yes, you asked me to call her back. See how well she can turn? She can turn and turn, and then turn on you again. And she can cry, siroh, how she can cry! And shes obedient, as you say, obedient. Very obedientkeep crying.Concerning thisoh, what fake emotion!I am being ordered homeGet away from me, Ill send for you later.Sir, Ill obey the order and return to Venice. Get away from me, you witch!
</T>
<T>
Cassio can have my job. And tonight, sir, I invite you have dinner with me. Welcome to Cyprus. Horny animals!
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
Is this the same Moor whom the senate considers so capable? Is this the guy whos supposed to never get emotional, and who never gets rattled, no matter what disaster happens?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Hes changed a great deal.
</T>
<T>
LODVICO
Is he sane? Is he losing his mind?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
He is what he is. I wont say anything negative about what he might be. If he isnt what he might be, then I wish to God he were!
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
Hitting his wife?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Its true, that wasnt such a nice thing to do. But I wish I could say thats the last time hell do it!
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
Is it a habit of his? Or did the letter make him emotional somehow, and this is the first time hes done it?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Oh, its too bad! It wouldnt be right for me to tell you everything Ive seen and heard. Youll see what hes like. His own actions will show you what kind of person he is, so I wont have to bother telling you. Just go after him and watch what he does next.
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
Im sorry I was so wrong about him.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
You havent seen anything, then?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
No, and I didnt hear anything either, or suspect anything at all.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
But youve seen her and Cassio together.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Yes, but I didnt see anything wrong, and I heard every syllable they said.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Didnt they ever whisper?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Never, my lord.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Or ask you to leave the room?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Never.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Not even to get her fan, or her gloves, or her mask, or anything?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
No, my lord.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Thats strange.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Id swear to you on my soul that shes a good, honest person, sir. If you suspect otherwise, stop thinking that right now because youre wrong. If any jerk has tried to convince you shes bad, I hope God curses him. If shes not honest, faithful, and true, then theres no such thing as a faithful wife or a happy husband.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Tell her to come here. Go.
</T>
<T>
She says all the right things, but the dumbest brothel-keeper would tell the same story. Desdemonas a tricky whore with a closet full of awful secrets, but still shell kneel and pray like an honest woman. Ive seen her do it.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
My lord, what do you want?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Please, dear, come here.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
What can I do for you?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Let me see your eyes. Look at my face.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
What horrible thing are you imagining?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
(to EMILIA) Go do what you do best, madam. Leave us alone for our hanky-panky, and shut the door behind you. If somebody comes, give a shout. Thats your jobOthello implies that Emilia\s job is to help men and women have illicit sex.job, your job. Go on, hurry!
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Im begging you on my knees to tell me what your words mean. I can tell youre furious, but I dont understand what youre saying.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Why? Who are you?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Im your wife, your true and loyal wife.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Go ahead, swear to that, so youll be damned to hell for lying. Otherwise the devils will mistake you for an angel and be too scared to grab you. Go ahead, make sure you damn yourself by swearing youve been faithful to me.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Heaven knows I am.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Heaven knows youre as unfaithful as hell.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Unfaithful, my lord? With whom? How am I unfaithful?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Leave me alone, Desdemona, go away!
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Oh, what a horrible day! Why are you crying? Because of me? If youve been ordered back to Venice because of my father, dont blame me. You may have lost his respect, but so have I.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
If God had decided to treat me like Job, making me sick and covered with sores, reducing me to abject poverty, selling me into slavery and destroying all my hopes, I would have found some way to accept it with patience. But instead Hes made me a laughingstock for everyone in our time to point at and scorn! Even that I could put up with. But instead, my wife, whos supposed to
</T>
<T>
be like the fountain that my children and all my descendants flow from, has rejected me! Worse than that, shes polluted herself, so that the fountain is a place where disgusting toads copulate and reproduce! Even the goddess of patience couldnt look at this and be patientits too horrifying!
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
I hope you think Im faithful to you.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
As faithful as flies in rotting meat, which give birth to maggots every time the wind blows. Youre like a weed pretending to be a flower, so beautiful and sweet-smelling that I ache when I look at you. Oh, I wish youd never been born!
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Have I done something to offend you without knowing it?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Was someone as beautiful as you meant to be a whore? What have you done? What have you done? Oh, you streetwalker! If I said out loud what youve done, youd burn up with shame. What have you done? Heaven has to hold its nose when it sees you! The pure moon in the sky has to shut its eyes when you go by! Even the wind that blows over everything on earth is ashamed to visit you. You brazen whore!
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
I swear to God youre accusing me wrongly!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
So youre saying youre not a whore?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
No, Im as honest as I am Christian. If only letting my husband touch my body means Im not a whore, Im not a whore.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
What, youre not a whore?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
No, I swear it.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Is that possible?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Oh, heaven help us!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
I beg your pardon then. I must have the wrong woman. I mistook you for that sly Venetian woman who married Othello.You whorehouse-keeper.
</T>
<T>
Youre in charge of this hell! You! Weve finished our business. Heres some money for you. Please lock the door and keep quiet.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Whats he talking about? How are you, madam?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Im stunned, to tell you the truth.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
My lady, whats wrong with your husband?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
With who?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Why, with your husband, madam. My lord.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Whos your lord?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
My lord is your lord.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
I dont have a lord. Dont talk to me, Emilia. I cant even cry, though tears are the only answers I could give to all your questions. Tonight put my wedding sheets on my bed, and tell your husband to come to me now.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Things have certainly changed!
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Its fair for him to treat me like this, very fair. What have I ever done that he has anything to complain about?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
What can I do for you, madam? How are you?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
I dont know. When grown-ups teach little children, they do it gently and easily. He might have treated me like that, because Im as unused to abuse as a little child.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Whats the matter, lady?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
He called her a whore so many times, and heaped up so much abuse on her that good people cant stand to hear it.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Am I that name, Iago?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
What name, madam?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
What my lord said I was.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
He called her a whore. A beggar couldnt have called his slut worse names.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Why did he do that?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
I dont know. I just know Im not one.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Dont cry, dont cry. What a day this is!
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Did she give up all those chances to marry noblemen, give up her father and country and friends, just to be called a whore? Doesnt that make you want to cry?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Its just my bad luck.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Damn him! How did he get such an idea?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Heaven knows.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
I bet my life some evil busybody, some meddling, lying jerk made up this rumor to get some position. I bet my life on it.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Nobodys that bad. Its impossible.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
If there is, then heaven help him!
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
A hangmans noose will help him! Let hell chew him up! Why should he call her a whore? Whos been with her? When has she had the time, the place, or the means to sleep with anyone? How is this at all likely? The Moor is being tricked by some crook, some terrible villain, some rotten bastard. Oh, I wish we could unmask scoundrels like that, and give a whip to every good man to beat them senseless with!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Keep your voice down.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Oh, to hell with those people! Its the same kind of guy who got you upset and made you suspect Id cheated on you with the Moor.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Youre a fool. Shut up.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Oh God, Iago, what can I do to win my husband back again? Please go to him, my friend. I swear I have no idea why he stopped loving me. Here Im kneeling to swear that if I ever did anything to destroy his love for me, either by thoughts or actions, or if I ever took pleasure in anyone else, or if I never did love him, or dont love him noweven though he tries to shake me off
</T>
<T>
then I hope I have a life of misery! Unkindness is powerful, and his unkindness may kill me, but itll never destroy my love. I cant say whore. It makes me sick to say the word even now. I wouldnt do the thing that would make me a whore for all the money in the world.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Please calm down. Hes just in a bad mood. Political business is bothering him, and hes just taking it out on you.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
If only that were all it is
</T>
<T>
IAGO
It is, I promise.
</T>
<T>
Those trumpets are calling us in to dinner. The Venetians are waiting for their food. Go in, and dont cry. Everything will be all right.
</T>
<T>
How are you, Roderigo?
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
I dont think youre treating me fairly.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
What makes you say that?
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Every day you put me off with some trick. Instead of finding opportunities for me, you seem to be preventing me from making any progress.
</T>
<T>
Well, I wont take it any longer. And Im not going to sit back and accept what youve done.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Will you listen to me, Roderigo?
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Ive listened to you too much already. Your words and actions dont match up.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Thats not fair.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Its the truth. Ive got no money left. The jewels you took from me to deliver to Desdemona wouldve made even a nun want to sleep with me. You told me she got them, and that she promised to give me a little something in return soon, but nothing like that ever happens.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Well, all right then. Fine.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Fine! he says. All right! Its not fine, and Im not all right! Its wrong, and Im starting to realize Im being cheated!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Okay.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Its not okay! Im going to tell Desdemona my feelings. If she returns my jewels, Ill stop pursuing her and apologize to her. If not, Ill challenge you to a duel.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Youve said what you have to say now.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Yes, and Ill do everything I just said.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Well, all right then. Now I see that you have some guts. From this moment on I have a higher opinion of you than before. Give me your hand, Roderigo. Your complaint against me is perfectly understandable, but I still insist Ive done everything I could to help you.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
It doesnt look that way to me.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
I admit it doesnt look that way to me, and the fact that you suspect me shows that youre smart. But Roderigo, if youre as courageous and determined as I think you are, then wait just a bit longer. If youre not having sex with Desdemona tomorrow night, then I suggest you find some way to stab me in the back and kill me.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Well, whats your plan? Is it feasible?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Venice has made Cassio governor here on Cyprus.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Is that true? Then Desdemona and Othello will go back to Venice.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Oh, no. Hell go to Mauritania and take the beautiful Desdemona with him, unless he gets stuck here for some reason. The best way to extend his stay here is to get rid of Cassio.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
What do you mean, get rid of him?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
I mean knock his brains out, so he cant take Othellos place.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
And thats what you want me to do!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Yes, if you want to help yourself. Hes having dinner tonight with a prostitute, and Ill go visit him. He doesnt know hes been appointed governor yet. When you see him walking by here (as Ill make sure he does between twelve and one) you can nab him. Ill be nearby to help you, and between the two of us we can handle him. Come on, dont stand there in a daze. Come along with me. Ill give you such reasons for killing him that youll feel obliged to snuff him out. Its nearly dinner time, and the nights going to be wasted. Lets go!
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
I want to hear more about this.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
You will. Youll hear all you want to hear.
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
Please, sir, dont trouble yourself.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
I beg your pardon; walking will make me feel better.
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
Good night, madam. Thank you.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Youre most welcome.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Would you walk out with me, sir?Oh, Desdemona
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Yes, my lord?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Go to bed right this minute. Ill be there shortly. Send your maid Emilia away. Make sure you do what I say.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
I will, my lord.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
How are things now? He looks calmer than he did before.
</T>

DESDEMONA
He says hell come back right away. He asked me to go to bed and to send you away.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Send me away?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Thats what he said. So give me my nightgown, Emilia, and Ill say goodnight. We shouldnt displease him.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Yes. I wish youd never met him.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Thats not what I wish. I love him even when hes harsh and meanHelp me unpin this, would you?I love even his stubbornness, his frowns, his bad moods.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
I put those wedding sheets on your bed, as you asked.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
It doesnt matter. Oh, how silly we are! If I die before you do make sure Im wrapped in those sheets in my coffin.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Listen to you! Dont be silly!
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
My mother had a maid named Barbary. She was in love, and her lover turned out to be wild and left her. She knew an old song called Willow that reminded her of her own story, and she died singing it. I cant get that song out of my head tonight. Its all I can do to keep myself from hanging my head down in despair and singing it like poor Barbary. Please, hurry up.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Should I get your nightgown?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
No, just help me unpin this. That Lodovico is a good-looking man.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Hes very handsome.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
He speaks well.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
I know a lady in Venice whod walk all the way to Palestine for a kiss from him.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
(singing)
The poor soul sat singing by the sycamore tree,
Everyone sing the green willow,
She had her hand on her breast and her head on her knee,
Sing willow, willow, willow.
The fresh streams ran by her and murmured her moans,
Sing willow, willow, willow.
Her salt tears fell from her and softened the stones,
Sing willow, willow, willow.
Put these things over there.
Please, hurry, hell come right away.
Everyone sing, a green willow must be my garland.
Nobody blame him, hes right to hate me
No, thats not how it goes.Whos knocking?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Its the wind.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
(singing) I told my lover he didnt love me, but what did he say? Sing willow, willow, willow.
If I chase more women, youll sleep with more menOkay, go away now. Good night. My eyes itchis that an omen Ill be crying soon?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
No, it doesnt mean anything.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
I heard someone say thats what it means. Oh, these men, these men! Do you honestly thinktell me, Emiliathere are women whod cheat on their husbands in such a disgusting manner?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
There are women like that out there, no question.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Would you ever do such a thing for all the world?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Why, wouldnt you?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
By the light of heaven, no, I would not!
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
I wouldnt either, by daylight. It would be easier to do it in the dark.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Could you really do such a thing, for all the world?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
The worlds huge. Its a big prize for such a small sin.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
I dont think you would.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Actually I think I would, and then Id undo it after I did it. I wouldnt do it for a nice ring, or fine linen, or pretty gowns or petticoats or hats. But for the whole world? Who wouldnt cheat on her husband to make him king? Id risk my soul for that.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Id never do such a bad thing, not for the whole world!
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Why, a bad action is just a wrong in this world, but when youve won the whole world, its a wrong in your own world, so you can make it right then.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
I dont think any woman like that exists.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Yes, a dozen of themas many as there are women in the world, in fact. But I do think its the husbands fault if we wives cheat on them. For instance, our husbands
</T>
<T>
may stop sleeping with us, and give it out to other women instead. Or they may get insanely jealous, and keep us from going anywhere. Or lets say they hit us, or cut back on the money they give us out of spite. We have feelings. We may be able to forgive them, but we want to get back at them too. Husbands need to know that their wives are human beings too. They see, smell, and taste sweet and sour just like their husbands. Why do they replace us with other women? Do they do it for fun? I think they do. Is it out of lust? I think so. Is it a weakness? It is. And dont we have passions, and a taste for fun, and weaknesses, just like men? Then tell them to treat us well. Or let them figure out that the bad things we do are just what we learned from them.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Good night, good night. I pray that God will let me learn from women like thatnot to follow their bad example, but to avoid it!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Here, stand behind this wall; hell come right away. Keep your sword out, and then stick it in as far as itll go. Quick, quick. Dont be afraid. Ill be right next to you. This will either make us or break us. Keep that in mind, and be steady.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Stay right near me. I may mess it up.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Im right behind you. Be bold, and get ready.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
I dont really want to do this, but hes given me good reasons. I guess its only one manno big deal. My sword comes out, and he dies.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
(to himself) Ive rubbed this young pimple until hes ready to pop, and now hes angry. Whether he kills Cassio, or Cassio kills him, or they kill each other, it all works in my favor. If Roderigo survives, though, hell ask me for all the gold and jewelry that I stole from him and said I gave to Desdemona. I cant let that happen. If Cassio survives,hes so handsome and well-spoken that he makes me look ugly. And besides, the Moor might tell him about my lies about him.That would be very dangerous for me. No, hes got to die. Let it be so. I hear him coming.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
I know the sound of his walk.Die, villain!
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
That thrust might really have hurt me if I didnt have this armor on under my cloak. Now lets see what youve got on.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Oh, Im dead!
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Ill be crippled forever! Help! Murder! murder!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Thats Cassios voice. Iago has kept his word.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Oh, what a villain I am!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Thats the truth.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Help me! Get some light! Get me a surgeon!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Its him! Brave Iago, how honest and trustworthy you are! You even went as far as murder to help your friend in his misfortune. You teach me how I should act.
</T>
<T>
Whore, your lovers dead now, and youll be going to hell soon. Im coming, slut! Ive shut the memory of your beautiful eyes out of my heart. Youve already stained our sheets with your lust; now Ill stain them with your whores blood.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Help! Isnt there a guard around? No one passing by? Murder! Murder!
</T>
<T>
GRATIANO
Somethings wrong, the man sounds panicked.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Oh, help!
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
Listen!
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Ive acted like such a villain!
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
Two or three men are groaning. But its dark out, and it could be a trap. Its not safe to go near them till we get more help.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Nobodys coming? Ill bleed to death.
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
Look!
</T>
<T>
GRATIANO
Heres someone coming in his pajamas, with a candle and weapons.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Whos there? Whos shouting murder?
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
We dont know.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Didnt you hear someone shouting?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Im here, here! For heavens sake, help me!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Whats the matter?
</T>
<T>
GRATIANO
(to LODOVICO) Thats Othellos ensign, I think.
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
It is. Hes a good man.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
(to CASSIO) Whos shouting so loudly?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Is that you, Iago? Im here, Ive been destroyed by villains! Help me.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Oh, lieutenant! What villains did this to you?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
I think one of them is nearby and cant get away.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
The treacherous criminals!(to LODOVICO and GRATIANO) Whos there? Come here and help!
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Somebody help me over here!
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Thats one of them.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
(to RODERIGO) Murderer! Villain!
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Damned Iago! You inhuman dog!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Killing men in the dark? Where are these murderers? This is such a quiet, sleepy town!Murder, murder!Whos that coming? Are you good or evil?
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
Judge for yourself.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Signor Lodovico?
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
Thats me.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
I beg your pardon. Cassios been wounded.
</T>
<T>
GRATIANO
Cassio!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
How are you doing, brother?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
My legs been cut in two.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
God forbid! Bring me some light, gentlemen, Ill bind the wound with my shirt.
</T>
<T>
BIANCA
Whats the matter? Whos shouting?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Whos shouting?
</T>
<T>
BIANCA
Oh, my dear Cassio! My sweet Cassio! Oh, Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
You notorious whore! Cassio, do you know who might have stabbed you like this?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
No.
</T>
<T>
GRATIANO
Im sorry to find you like this. Ive been looking all over for you.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Lend me your sashOh, if we only had a stretcher to carry him out of here!
</T>
<T>
BIANCA
Hes fainted! Oh Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Sir, I believe this piece of trash, Bianca, has something to do with all this trouble.Hang in there, Cassio.Come here, bring the light. Do you recognize this face? Oh, no, its my friend and countryman, Roderigo.Yes, its Roderigo!
</T>
<T>
GRATIANO
What, Roderigo from Venice?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Thats the one, sir. Do you know him?
</T>
<T>
GRATIANO
Know him? Yes.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Signor Gratiano, I beg your pardon. I didnt mean to ignore youits just because of this bloody uproar.
</T>
<T>
GRATIANO
Im glad to see you.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
How are you doing, Cassio?Someone bring me a stretcher!
</T>
<T>
GRATIANO
Roderigo!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Its him, its him.
</T>
<T>
Goodheres the stretcher. Get somebody strong to carry him out of here. Ill get the generals surgeon. (to BIANCA) As for you, ma'am, dont bother. The man lying here was my dear friend, Roderigo.What was the problem between you?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
There wasnt any problem. I dont even know him.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
(to BIANCA) Youre pale?Get Cassio out of here.You look awfully pale, Bianca.
</T>
<T>
Do you see how afraid she is? Watch her, well get the whole story. Keep an eye on her. Do you see? The guilty speak volumes even when theyre silent.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Whats the matter? Whats the matter, husband?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Cassio was attacked here in the dark by Roderigo and men who escaped. Hes near death, and Roderigos dead already.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Oh, no, good gentleman! Oh no, good Cassio!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
This is what happens when you visit whores. Please, Emilia, ask Cassio where he was at dinner tonight.(to BIANCA) What, does that make you nervous?
</T>
<T>
BIANCA
He ate at my house, but that doesnt make me nervous.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Oh, did he? I order you to come with me.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Go to hell, you whore!
</T>
<T>
BIANCA
Im no whore. Im as moral as you are.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
As moral as me! Damn you!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Gentlemen, lets go make sure Cassios wounds are properly dressed.Come on, ma'am, you can tell us another story. Emilia, go to the castle and tell Othello and Desdemona what happened.Will you please go now? (to himself) This is the night thatll either make me or break me.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
I have to do it, I have to do it. I have to keep my reason in mind. I wont say out loud what my reason is, but I have to do it. But I wont shed any of her blood or scar that beautiful skin, whiter than snow and smooth as the finest marble. But shes got to die, or shell cheat on other men. Put out the light of the candle, and then put out the light of her heart. If I extinguish the candle, I can light it again if I regret it. But once I kill you, you beautiful, fake woman, I do not know the magic that could bring you back. When Ive plucked this rose, I cant make it grow again; it will have no choice but to wither and die. Let me smell you while youre still on the tree. (he kisses her) Oh, that sweet breath almost convinces me not to kill you and carry out justice. One more, one more kiss. If youre this beautiful when youre dead, Ill kill you and then love you afterward. (kissing her) One more, and this is the last. Such a sweet kiss was never so deadly. I have to cry, but I have to be cruel too. Im acting like God in the Old TestamentI have to punish the one I love. Shes waking up.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Whos there? Othello?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Yes, Desdemona.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Will you come to bed, my lord?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Have you said your prayers tonight, Desdemona?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Yes, my lord.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
If you can think of any crime you havent confessed, then pray for forgiveness right away.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Oh, my lord, what do you mean by that?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Well, hurry up and confess. Be quick about it. Ill wait over here. I dont want to kill you before youve readied your soul. No, I dont want to send your soul to hell when I kill you.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Youre talking about killing?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Yes, I am.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Then heaven have mercy on me.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Amen to that, from the bottom of my heart.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
If you really feel that way, then I hope you wont kill me.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Hmmph!
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Youre scaring me. You terrify me when you have that look in your eyes. I dont know why I should be afraid, since I havent done anything wrong. But Im still afraid.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Think of your sins.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
My only sin was loving you too much.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Yes, thats why you have to die.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Youre wrong to kill me for loving you. Why are you chewing on your lower lip like that? Youre shaking with emotion. These are bad omens, but I hope, I hope, they dont predict my future.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Quiet. Stay still.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
I will. Whats this all about?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
You gave that handkerchief, the one I loved and gave to you, to Cassio.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
No, I swear by my life and soul! Bring him here and ask him.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
My sweet darling, dont lie. Youre on your deathbed.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
I am? But Im not dying yet!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Yes, right now. So confess your sin freely now. Even if you swear youre innocent of every accusation, you wont change my mind or remove the thought thats tormenting me. Youre going to die.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Then heaven have mercy on me!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Amen to that.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
And you have mercy on me too! I never did anything wrong to you in my life. I never loved Cassio, except with the pure love that I feel for humankind. I never gave him any token of romantic love.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
I saw him holding the handkerchief! You liar, youre turning my heart to stone, and making me call what Ill do murder, when I had been thinking of it as a sacrifice! I saw the handkerchief.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
He found it somewhere, then. I never gave it to him. Tell him to come here. Hell tell the truth.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Hes already done so.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
What, my lord?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
That he had sex with you.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
What? Had sex with me?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Yes.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
He wouldnt say that.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
No. He wont say anything anymore. Honest Iagos arranged that.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Oh, Im scared. What, is he dead?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
If he had as many lives as hes got hairs on his head, I wouldve killed them all in revenge.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Oh, hes been betrayed, and Ive been ruined.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
What, you whore, are you crying for him right in front of me?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Send me away, my lord, but dont kill me!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
DownOthello probably wrestles her down.Down, whore!
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Kill me tomorrowbut let me live tonight.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
No, if you struggle with me
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Just half an hour!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
While Im doing this, I cant pause for a moment.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Just let me say one prayer!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Its too late. (he smothers her)
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
(offstage) My lord, my lord! Hello! My lord, my lord!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Whats that noise? Arent you dead yet? I know Im cruel, but Im merciful too. I dont want you to linger in pain.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
(offstage) Hello! My lord, my lord!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Whos there?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
(offstage) Oh my lord, I need to speak to you!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Yes, its Emilia.(to EMILIA)Just a minute!Shes dead now.Emilias probably come to tell me that Cassios been killed. The fight outside was loud. So! Youre not moving anymore? No, youre as still as a grave. Should I let her in? Is that a good idea? I think shes moving againNo. What should I do? If she comes in, shell try to speak to my wife. My wife, my wife! What wife? I dont have a wife. Oh, this is unbearable! Oh, the horror! There should be a huge eclipse of the sun and the moon, now that Desdemonas no longer on this earth.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
(offstage) Please, my lord. I need to speak with you. Oh, my good lord!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Id forgotten about youEmilia, wait a moment, let me draw the curtains. (closes the bed curtains) Where are you? (unlocks the door)
</T>
<T>
Whats the matter with you now?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Oh, my lord, terrible murders have been committed over there!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
What? Just now?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Yes, just now, my lord.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Its because of the full moon. It comes too close to the earth and drives men crazy.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Cassios killed a young Venetian named Roderigo.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Roderigos been killed? And Cassios killed?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
No, Cassio wasnt killed.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Cassios not dead? Then the wrong man is dead, and sweet revenge has gone wrong.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Oh, Ive been murdered unfairly!
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Oh Lord, whos that crying?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
That? What?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Oh, no, that was my ladys voice.
</T>
<T>
Help! Help! Oh, lady, speak again.
Sweet Desdemona! Oh sweet mistress, speak!
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Im dying an innocent woman.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Oh, who did this thing?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
No one. I did it myself. Give my love to my kind husband. Oh, goodbye!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Why, how could she have been murdered?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
My God, who knows?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
You heard her say it wasnt me.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Yes, she said that. I must go report what happened.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
She was lying even as she was going down to hell. I did kill her.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Then she was even more an angel, and youre an even blacker devil!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
She cheated on me, and she was a whore.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
You slander her, you devil.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
She was fickle and unfaithful, like water.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Youve lost your mind to accuse her of cheating. She was utterly true to you!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Cassio had sex with her. Ask your husband if you doubt me. If I didnt have a good reason to do this, damn me to the very bottom of hell. Your husband knew about everything.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
My husband!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Your husband.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
He said she was unfaithful?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Yes, with Cassio. If shed been faithful to me, I never would have given her up, not even if God himself offered me a jewel as big as a planet in exchange for her.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
My husband.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Yes, hes the one who first told me about her. Hes an honest man who detests evil actions.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
My husband?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Why do you keep repeating that, woman? Im telling you, your husband.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Oh, my mistress, a villain has made a mockery of your love! My husband said she was unfaithful!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Yes, him, woman. I said your husband.Do you understand that word? My friend, your husband, the honest, honest Iago.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
If he said that, then I hope his malicious soul rots in hell forever. Hes lying through his teeth! She was too attached to her filthy marriage ever to do a thing like that!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Ha!
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Go ahead, do your worst. Killing me wont send you to heaven. You werent good enough for her.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Youd better shut up!
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
I can endure far more pain than you could ever give me! Oh, you idiot! You stupid fool! As dumb as dirt! Youve committed a terrible evilIm not afraid of your sword. Ill tell everyone what you did, even if it
</T>
<T>
costs me my life twenty times over.Help, help, help! The Moors killed my mistress! Murder, murder!
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
Whats the matter? Whats going on here, general?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Oh, are you here, Iago? Youve done a good job, that other men can attribute their murders to you!
</T>
<T>
GRATIANO
Whats the matter?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
(to IAGO) Tell this villain hes wrong, if youre man enough. He says you told him his wife cheated on him. I know you didnt. Youre not that much of a villain. Speak, because Im too emotional to say any more.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
I told him what I thought. I didnt tell him anything that didnt make sense or ring true to him.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
But did you tell him she cheated on him?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
I did.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Then you told a lie, a sick, wicked lie. I swear on my soul it was a lie. You said she slept with Cassio. Did you say Cassio?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Yes, with Cassio. Now be quiet.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
I will not be quiet! I have to speak. My mistress here lies murdered in her bed
</T>
<T>
ALL
No, heaven forbid!
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
And your lies caused this murder.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Dont stand there gaping, everyone. Its true.
</T>
<T>
GRATIANO
It may be true, but its unbelievable.
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
Oh, what a horrible deed!
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Evil, evil, evil! I can smell it! I suspected it earlier. Ill kill myself out of grief! Oh, evil, evil!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Are you crazy? Im ordering you, go home.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Good gentlemen, give me permission to speak. I know I ought to obey my husband, but not now. Maybe Ill never go home again, Iago!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Oh! Oh! Oh!
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Yes, go ahead and moan, because you killed the sweetest, most innocent woman who ever lived!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
She was filthy! I barely knew you, Uncle GratianoGratiano is Brabantios brother and Desdemonas uncle.Gratiano. Heres your niece lying here dead. I killed her with these hands. I know this looks horrible.
</T>
<T>
GRATIANO
Poor Desdemona! Im glad your father isnt alive to see this. Your marriage made him die of grief before his time. If he was alive now, this sight would hurt
</T>
<T>
him terribly. It would make him curse the heavens and be damned to hell.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Its sad, but Iago knows she had sex with Cassio a thousand times. Cassio confessed it, and she pledged her love to him by giving him the handkerchief Id given her. I saw it in his hand.
It was an old memento that my father gave to my mother.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Oh, God! Dear God in heaven!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Damn it, shut your mouth.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
No, the truth will come outMe, shut my mouth? Let heaven and men and devils tell me to shut me up. Ill say what I have to say.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
If youre smart, youll go home.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
I wont.
</T>
<T>
GRATIANO
Shame on you! Drawing your sword on a woman?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Oh, you stupid Moor! I found that handkerchief by accident and gave it to my husband. Hed begged me to steal it many times.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
You evil whore!
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
You think she gave it to Cassio? No, I found it and gave it to my husband.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
You piece of filth, youre lying!
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
I swear Im not lying. (to OTHELLO) Oh, you murderous fool! How did you ever get such a good wife?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Wont heaven strike this Iago dead? You absolute villain!
</T>
<T>
GRATIANO
The womans falling down! Hes killed his wife!
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Yes, yes! Lay me next to my mistress.
</T>
<T>
GRATIANO
Hes gone, and his wifes dead.
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
Hes a wicked, horrible criminal. Take the Moors sword and guard the door from the outside. Kill him rather than let him leave this room. Im going after Iago. Hes a horrid criminal.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Im not that strong, if a puny nobody can grab my sword. But why should my reputation for honor last longer than my honor did? Let it all go.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
What did your song mean, lady? Can you hear me? Ill die like a swan. They sing when they die.
(singing) Willow, willow, willow.
Moor, she never cheated on you. She loved you, you cruel man. I swear on my soul Im telling the truth, and as I say this, I die.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Ive got another weapon in the room. Its a Spanish sword, hardened in ice cold water and razor sharp. Here it is. Uncle, Im coming out!
</T>
<T>
GRATIANO
(offstage) If you try that, youll pay for it. Youve got no weapon, so youll have to suffer.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Look in on me, and talk with me, or Ill attack even without a weapon.
</T>
<T>
GRATIANO
Whats the matter?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Look, I have a weapon, the best sword a soldier could have. Ive fought my way through obstacles twenty times more terrifying than you with this weapon. But
</T>
<T>
who can control his fate? Im not like that now. Dont be afraid, even though you see me with a weapon. This is the end of my journey, the end of my life. Are you backing away in fear? Theres no reason to be afraid. You could tap me with a feather and Id back away. Where would Othello go?Oh, look at you! Such cruel luck! Youre as pale as your nightgown! When we meet on Judgment Day, that look of yours will send me from heaven to hell, where devils will grab me. Youre cold, cold, and you were never hot with lust. Oh you damned villain! Whip me, you devils, so I dont have to look at this heavenly sight! Blow on me with hot winds, roast me in lava, drown me in liquid fire! Oh, Desdemona! Dead Desdemona! Oh, oh!
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
Where is that poor rash man?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
You mean the man who used to be Othello? Here I am.
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
Wheres that snake? Bring the villain forward.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Im looking to see if you have cloven hooves like the devil. But thats just a fairy tale. If you are a devil, I wont be able to kill you.
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
Take his sword away from him.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Im bleeding, but you didnt kill me.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Im not sorry, either. I want you to live, since to me, death is happiness.
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
Oh Othello, you were once so good, then you were tricked by this villain. What can I say to you?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Say anything. Call me an honorable murderer if you like. I did nothing out of hate, only out of honor.
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
This poor guys partly confessed his plan. Did you plan Cassios death with him?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Yes.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Dear general, I never gave you any reason to hate me.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
I believe you, and I ask you to forgive me. Will you please make this half-devil say why he tricked me and damned my soul?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Dont ask me anything. You know what you know. From this moment on, Ill never say another word.
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
What, not even to pray?
</T>
<T>
GRATIANO
Torture will make you talk.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Well, do your best.
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
Sir, youll understand everything that has happened. I dont think you know now. Here is a letter we found in Roderigos pocket. And heres another. This one talks about how Roderigo should kill Cassio.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Oh, you villain!
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Ungodly and monstrous!
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
Heres another letter from his pocket, addressed to Iago and full of complaints. We think he was going to send it to Iago, but then Iago stepped in and answered his complaints by killing him.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Oh, you wicked scoundrel! Cassio, how did you get my wifes handkerchief?
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
I found it in my room, and Iago just confessed that he put it there for his own purposes.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Oh, what a fool I am!
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Also, in his letter to Iago, Roderigo criticizes Iago for telling him to get me angry while I was on guard duty, and get me demoted. And just now he admitted it, even though hed seemed to be dead for a long whileIago tricked him, Iago urged him to do it.
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
(to OTHELLO)
Youll have to leave this room and come with us. Youre stripped of your power and your command, and Cassio will govern Cyprus. As for this slave, Iago, if we can think of any torture that will hurt him a lot but keep him alive a long time, hell have it. Youll remain a prisoner until we bring your crimes to the Venetian government.Okay, take him away.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Wait. A word or two before you go. Ive given the state of Venice a bit of help in the past, and they know it. But enough about that. When you record these sad events in your letters, please describe me exactly as I am. Dont tone things down or exaggerate them out of hostility. If youre being fair, youll have to describe me as someone who loved too much, but who wasnt wise about it. I was not easily made jealous, but once I was tricked and manipulated, I worked myself into a frenzy. Describe me as a fool who threw away a precious pearl with his own hands, like a silly Indian who didnt know what it was worth. As someone who was not emotional, but who then cried a lot. Write all this
</T>
<T>
down, and then say also that in Aleppo I once saw a Turk beating a Venetian, so I grabbed the Turk by the throat and hit him like this.
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
Oh, what a bloody end to all this!
</T>
<T>
GRATIANO
Everything weve heard is bad.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
(to DESDEMONA) I kissed you before I killed you. Now, killing myself, Im dying while I kiss you again.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
I was afraid this would happen, because he was a noble, brave man, but I didnt think he had a weapon.
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
(to IAGO) You bloodthirsty dog, youre crueler than sadness or hunger, crueler than the sea. Look at these dead people on this bed. You did all this. He makes me sick. Take him away. Gratiano, take care of the house, and take the Moors property. Youve inherited everything.(to CASSIO) Governor, I leave it in your hands to punish this evil villain: just decide the time, the place and the means of torture. And then carry it out! I have to go back to Venice, and tell them about these sad events.
