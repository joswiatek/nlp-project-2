EGEON
Continue, Solinus, and bring on my downfall. Give me the death sentence and end all my troubles.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Merchant of Syracuse, stop your begging: Im not inclined to bend our laws. The hatred and discord between our two cities is the result of the bitter offenses your duke has perpetrated against the merchants of Ephesus, our well-behaved countrymen. Lacking the money to ransom themselves, these merchants were executed under your dukes harsh laws, and this has erased all looks of pity from my face. Ever since these deadly conflicts erupted between your violent countrymen and ours, both you Syracusians and we Ephesians have held serious councils and decided not to permit any travel between our two hostile towns. Nothe law goes further: if anyone born in Ephesus is seen in Syracuses marketplaces or if anyone born in Syracuse comes to Ephesus, that man dies, and his possessions will be confiscated by the Duke, unless he can raise a thousand marks to pay the penalty and ransom himself. Your possessions, even if we calculate their worth very generously, dont even add up to a hundred marks. Therefore, by law, you are condemned to die.
</T>
<T>
EGEON
At least I have this comfort: when you finish speaking, my troubles will also end, at sundown.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Well, Syracusian, tell usbrieflywhy you left your hometown and came to Ephesus.
</T>
<T>
EGEON
Asking me to speak of my unspeakable griefsthats the hardest task you could impose on me. But Ill do it so that the world can see that it was natural emotion, and not a desire to break the law, that brought me to this fate. Ill tell you whatever my sorrow permits me to say. I was born in Syracuse, and I married a womana fortunate woman, except for having been married to me. And yet I would have made her happy had our luck not been so bad. I lived with her in joy, and our wealth increased from the prosperous journeys I frequently made to Epidamnum. Then my agent died and, obligated to care for my now untended goods abroad, I was drawn away from my wifes fond embraces. I hadnt been gone for six months when my wife, almost fainting with the pains of pregnancy, made arrangements to follow me, and she soon arrived safely where I was. She hadnt been there very long before she became the joyful mother of twin boys. It was strange: they looked so much alike that the only way to tell them apart was by their names. In the same hour, and in the same inn, a poor woman also delivered identical twin boys. Their parents had very little, so I bought the boys and raised them as companions and servants for our twin sons. My wife was more than a little proud of our two boys, and every day she would press me to return home. Reluctantly, I agreedalas! Too quickly, we boarded a ship.
</T>
<T>
We had sailed a leagueleague = about three milesleague away from Epidamnum before the sea, which always obeys the winds' commands, gave any indication of danger.
We didnt stay hopeful much longer: soon, the sky grew so dark that we were convinced we were going to die immediately. I could have accepted that, but I was forced by my wifes incessant weepingshe wept in advance for the things that she saw aheadand the piteous complaints of the sweet infantswho cried in imitation of the adults, without understanding whyto find a way to save us. Heres the best I could do: the crew of our ship had fled for safety in the lifeboats and left us to sink with the ship. My wife, who was very concerned about the younger of our twins, tied him to a spare mastthe kind that sailors use for just such a purpose. She tied one of the other twins to him. I did the same with the remaining two boys. With the children taken care of, my wife and I tied ourselves to opposite ends of the mast and floated off, obedient to the current. It carried us toward Corinthor so we thought. Eventually the sun, looking down upon the earth, burned off the threatening storm clouds. By the power of the suns wished-for light, the seas became calm. We saw two ships sailing toward us, one from Corinth, the other from Epidaurus. But before they reached uslet me say no more! Youll have to imagine what came next, based on what had already happened.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
No, keep going, old man; dont stop like that. For we may take pity on you, even if we cant pardon you.
</T>
<T>
EGEON
Had the gods taken pity on us, I wouldnt be here calling them merciless. The two ships hadnt come within ten leagues of us when our ship hit a huge rock and split down the middle. As we were unjustly separated from each other, both my wife and I were left with something to delight in and something to sorrow over. For her partthe poor soul! Her half of the mast weighed less, but she was no luckier than I was: the wind carried her away more quickly. I saw them rescued by fishermen from Corinthor so I thought. After a while, another ship rescued me and the two boys who were with me. The sailors knew me, so they took good care of us. Our ship would have caught up with the other ship and taken back my wife and the children, but we sailed too slowly and their ship sped toward their home. So now youve heard how I was separated from everything I love. Its been my bad luck to remain alive long enough to be able to tell the sad stories of my own misfortunes.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
And for the sake of those you grieve for, do me a favor: tell me the full story of what has happened to you and them, up to this point.
</T>
<T>
EGEON
My youngest son, whom I care about the most, turned eighteen and started to wonder about his twin brother. He asked me to let him take his attendantwho had also lost a brother, though he had kept his brothers
</T>
<T>
name for himselfand go in search of him. I wanted to see my lost son as well, so I risked losing the one I loved in order to find the other. Ive spent five years in the remotest parts of Greece and roaming all over Asia. On my way home, I came to Ephesus. I have no hope of finding my boys here, but I will check every place that is inhabited by men. But that is where the story of my life must end. Id be happy to die if, in all my travels, I could prove that they are alive.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Poor Egeon! Fate has decreed that you must endure the extremes of terrible misfortune. Believe me, if it werent against the law, my crown, my duty, and my position (which princes cannot disobey, not matter how they feel), my very soul would argue your case. But you are sentenced to death, and changing a sentence thats already been passed would dishonor my title. However, Ill do what I can for you. I will allow you one day to look for help in Ephesus. Call any friends you have. Beg or borrow to come up with the ransom. If you can, you live. If not, you are doomed to die. Jailer, take him into custody.
</T>
<T>
JAILER
I will.
</T>
<T>
EGEON
Hopeless and helpless, I go my way, merely putting off my fatal end.
</T>
<T>
FIRST MERCHANT
So, tell people that youre from Epidamnumotherwise all your goods will be confiscated. Just today, a merchant from Syracuse was arrested for coming here. He couldnt afford the ransom, so by law, hell be put to death before the sun sets. Heres the money you asked me to hold.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Dromio, bring this money to the Centaur Inn, where were lodging, and wait there until I come. Itll be lunchtime within an hour. Until then, Ill walk around town, peruse the markets, and gaze upon the buildings, and then Ill return and sleep at the inn. Im stiff and weary from all this travel. Get going now.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Many men would take you literally and take off with all this money.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Hes a trustworthy servant. Often, when Im dulled by worry and melancholy, he lightens my mood with his merry pranks. Listen, will you walk with me around the town and then dine with me at the inn?
</T>
<T>
FIRST MERCHANT
Begging your pardon, but Ive been invited to see some merchants, who Im hoping to see a profit from. But if
</T>
<T>
it pleases you, Ill meet you in the marketplace at five and will keep you company until bedtime. Right now, my pressing business calls me away.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Farewell till then. I will go lose myself, wandering up and down throughout the city.
</T>
<T>
FIRST MERCHANT
Sir, I leave you to your own contentment.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
He leaves me to my own contentment, but thats the one thing I cannot find. Out in the world, Im like a drop of water, trying to find a drop that matches in the whole wide ocean. When that drop fails its taskunnoticed, inquisitiveit dissipates into the ocean and destroys itself. In order to find a mother and a brother, I too have lost myself, unhappily.
</T>
<T>
Here comes the man who shares my birthday. What is it? How is it that youve come back so soon?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Back so soon? Too late is more like it. The chicken is burning, the pig is overcooked, the clock has already struck twelve, and my mistress has clocked me one on the cheek. Shes hot because lunch is cold; lunch is cold because youre not home; youre not home because youre not hungry; youre not hungry because youve eaten already. But we servantswho know how to properly fast and prayare being punished for your offenses today.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Hold on a second. Answer me this, please: wheres the money I gave you?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Oh, the sixpence you gave me last Wednesday to buy leather goods for my mistress? The saddle maker has it, sirI didnt keep it.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Im not in a joking mood. Tell me right now and stop fooling: wheres the money? Were strangers here. How dare you let such a large amount escape your keeping?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Please, sir; crack jokes over lunch. My mistress made me hurry here. If I go back without you, shell punish your faults by breaking my head open. I should think that your appetite would act like a clock (as mine does) and bring you home on its own, without the need for a messenger.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Thats enough, Dromio, please. This isnt a good moment for jokessave them till a happier time. Wheres the gold I gave you?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Gave me, sir? You didnt give me any gold.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Come on, you rogue. Quit joking. Tell me what youve done with the money I entrusted to you.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
The only thing that Ive been entrusted with was getting you from the market and bringing you to your house, the Phoenix, for lunch. My mistress and her sister are waiting for you.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Tell me where youve stowed away my money, or I swear Ill break that comical head of yours for goofing when Im not in the mood. Where are the thousand marksmarks = units of currencymarks you had from me?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I have some marks from you on my head and some of my mistresss marks on my body. But between the both of you, I dont have a thousand marks. If I gave those marks back to you, chances are you wouldnt take them as patiently as I did.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Your mistresss marks? What mistress do you have?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Your wife, sir. My mistress. At the Phoenix. The one whos waiting for you to come home for lunch and praying that youll get home quickly.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What, are you going to mock me to my face when I told you not to? There, take that, you scoundrel! (beats DROMIO OF EPHESUS)
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
What are you doing? Stop, for Gods sake! Well, if you dont, then Im out of here.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I swear, somehow the fool has been cheated out of all my money. They say that this town is full of deceptionillusionists that can fool the eye, dark sorcerers who can bewitch your mind, soul-killing witches who can disfigure your body, disguised swindlers, fast-talking fakers, and all kinds of other unchecked sins. If this is true, then Ill be leaving all the sooner.
Ill go to the Centaur to find this servant of mineI fear that my money isnt safe.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Neither my husband nor the slave has returned, even though I sent the slave off running. Surely, Luciana, its already two o'clock.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Maybe some merchant at the marketplace invited him home for lunch. Sister, lets eat and stop worrying. A man is master of his own freedom: time is his only master, and when the right moment comes along, hell come or go as he pleases. If this is so, be patient, sister.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Why should men be more free than women?
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Because their business lies outside the home.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Listen, when I behave this way toward him, he hates it.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Oh, you should know that hes the bridlebridle = muzzlelike device used to restrain a horsebridle to your will.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Only a mule would agree to that.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Why, too much freedom leads to woe. Theres nothing under heaven that doesnt have its limits. The beasts on the earth, the fish in the sea, and the birds in the sky are all subject to the males of their species and under their control. Men, who are nearest to God, are the masters of all these creatures. And menthe lords of the wide
</T>
<T>
world and the wild watery seas, gifted with intellectual sense and souls, greater than the fish and the birdsare the masters of women and their lords. Therefore, you should obey their wishes.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Its this servantlike mentality thats keeping you unmarried.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
No, thats not itits because of what happens in the marriage bed.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
But if you were married, youd wield some influence.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Before I learn how to love, Ill learn how to follow orders.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
What if your husband strays elsewhere?
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Id endure it until he came home again.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Now thats patience! No wonder shes waiting to get married. Its easy to preach meekness when you have no reason to act otherwise. When were faced with a wretched person, bruised and crying with hardship, we try to get them to shush up. And yet, if we were suffering the same kind of pain, wed complain just as muchif not more! So you, who have no husband causing you problems, want to comfort me by preaching the virtue of feeble patience. But if you live to see yourself similarly denied your rights, this foolish patience will abandon you.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Well, Ill get married one day, just to see. Here comes your servantyour husband must be coming soon.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Tell me, is your tardy master close at hand?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
No; but he came at me with two handsjust ask my earsi.e., He beat me on my ears.ears.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Did you talk to him? Do you know his plans?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Yes, yes, he told me his plans on my ears. Damn his handsI could barely understandDromio puns on understand, using the word to mean stand up under the force of the beating.understand it.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Did he speak so ambiguously that you couldnt get a feeling for what he meant?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
No; he hit me very clearly and I felt his punches perfectly well. They were so dreadful, I could barely stand up under them.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
But please, tell me: is he coming home? It seems he has taken great care to please his wife.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Why, mistress, my master is as angry as a bull with horns.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Horns? You bastard!
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I dont mean hes cuckoldcuckold = a man whose wife cheated on him; cuckolds were commonly depicted wearing hornscuckold mad. But he sure is angry. When I asked him to come home to lunch, he asked me for a thousand marks. Its lunchtime, I said. My gold, he said. The meats burning, I said. My gold, he said. Will you come home? I said.
</T>
<T>
My gold, he said. Wheres the thousand marks I gave you, scoundrel? The pig, I said, is burned. My gold, he said. My mistress, I said. Damn your mistress! I dont know your mistress, the hell with your mistress!
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Who said that?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
My master said it. I dont know, he said, any house, wife, or mistress. My message, which was supposed to be delivered with my mouth, ended up being carried back home by my shoulders. Because at the end of it all, thats where he beat me.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Go back again, slave, and bring him home.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Go back again, to be beaten home again? For Gods sake, send somebody else.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Go back, slave, or Ill knock you one across the head.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
And hell add another knock across. With all these crosses, Ill have a holy head.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Get out of here, you blathering peasant! Bring your master home.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Do I treat you this roundly? Youre kicking me around like Im a football. You kick me out, he kicks me back. If I keep working for you, Im going to end up wrapped in leather, like a football.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Look at you! You have impatience all over your face.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
He feels the need to grace all his other tramps with his presence while I sit at home starving for a smile from him. Has homely old age taken the alluring beauty from my poor cheeks? Thats because he has squandered my beauty. Am I boring? Have I lost my wit? If my conversation is no longer free and clever, thats because hes dulled itIm like a sharp tool hes blunted with a hard piece of marble. Is he charmed by their pretty clothes? Well, thats not my faulthes the one in charge of my spending. What faults can you find in me that werent first caused by him? One smile from him would repair my decayed beauty. But like an unruly deer, hes always trespassing past the park borders and straying away from home to feed in new pastures. I am nothing but a poor, used fool.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
This jealousy is harming only you! Drive it out of you.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Only someone who doesnt feel this pain could tell me to ignore it. I know his eyes are worshiping some other woman, or why wouldnt he be here? Sister, you know he promised to give me a necklace. I would gladly do without that if he would only stay faithful to me. Even the best jewel can be tarnished. Gold, however, cant be corruptedthough it can be worn down if its touched too often. And no man with a reputation will tarnish that name with lies and bad behavior. Since my beauty no longer pleases my husband, Ill weep away whats left and then die with weeping.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
How many infatuated people go mad with jealousy!
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
The gold I gave Dromio is safe and sound at the Centaur, and the inn host says that Dromio has left and is looking for me. I havent spoken to him since I sent him away from the marketplace earlier. Here he comes.
</T>
<T>
So, sir. Are you over your ridiculous mood? If you like being hit, crack some more jokes. You never heard of the Centaur? You werent given any gold? Your mistress sent for me to come to dinner? The Phoenix is my house? Were you mad when you spoke to me so madly?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Said what, sir? When did I say all that?
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Just now. Right here. Less than half an hour ago.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I havent seen you since you sent me to the Centaur with the gold you gave me.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
You moron, you denied having any gold, and you told me about a mistress and a lunch. And I hope you realized I wasnt very happy about it.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Im glad to see you in such a merry mood. But whats the joke? Please, master, tell me.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What, are you mocking me to my face? You think Im joking? Here. Take that, and that! (beats DROMIO OF SYRACUSE)
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Stop, sir, for Gods sake! Now this joke has turned serious. Why are you doing this?
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Just because I act familiar with you sometimes and let you fool around and joke with me, you try to take advantage of my affection. You pull pranks when Im in a serious mood. You know, foolish gnats come out in the sunshine, but they creep back into their holes when its dark. If you want to crack jokes, first check what kind of mood Im in and then adjust your behavior to suit me. If you dont learn this rule, Ill have to beat it into your sconce.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
You call it my sconceDromio puns on various meanings of sconce,including head, fortress (which Dromio imagines being attacked with a battering ram), and curtain.sconce? Id rather call it my head so youd stop battering it. If you keep pounding me, Ill need a sconce to wrap my head with, or else Ill have to keep my brain in my chest. But sir, why are you beating me?
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Dont you know?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
All I know is that Im being beaten.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Should I tell you why?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Yes, and wherefore. You know the old saying: Every why has a wherefore.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Why first: for defying me. And then wherefore: for doing it a second time.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I dont think any mans ever been beaten for a why and wherefore that made so little sense. Well, thank you.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Thank me? For what?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Because you gave me something for nothing.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Next time Ill give you nothing for something. Is it lunchtime?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
No. The meat lacks something that I have.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What would that be?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
A basting.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Well, then it will be dry.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
If it is, I suggest you dont eat it.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Why not?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Because it will make you angry, and that will get me another beating.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Well, learn to make jokes at the appropriate time. Theres a time for all things.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Before you got so angry, I never would have thought that.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Why not?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Ill tell you: its because of a law as plain as Father Times bald head.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Lets hear it.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
There may be a time for everything, but no man who has gone bald naturally can get his hair back.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Cant he get it by fine and recoveryFine and recovery = a legal term related to claiming ownership of private propertyfine and recovery?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Yes, he can pay a fine for a wig and then recover another mans lost hair.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Why is Time so cheap about giving out hair? After all, its plentiful in its growth.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Because animals are blessed with hair. With men, hes been stingy with hair, but he makes up for it by giving them intelligence.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
But a lot of men have more hair than intelligence.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
And not one of them is smart enough to stop himself from going bald.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
So then, you must think that hairy men are honest and simpleminded.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
The more simpleminded they are, the sooner they lose their hairIn the original Shakespearean line, there are a series of sexual puns and jokes about venereal diseases-venereal disease can cause hair loss; sound can mean healthy, thing can refer to a sexual organ, and falsing means deceptive.lose their hair. But they have a good time doing so.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Why?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Two reasons. And good ones, too.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Not good ones, please.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Then sure ones.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
No, not sure ones when were talking about something unsure.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Then certain ones.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Name them.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
One, so they can save the money they spent on hairstyling, and two, so that when their hair falls out it doesnt land in their dinner.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
You were supposed to be proving that there isnt time for everything.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Right, and I did, sir. Theres no time to get back hair thats fallen out.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
You didnt come up with a very good proof.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Then Ill change it to this: Father Time himself is bald, so for all time there will be bald men.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I knew youd come up with a baldBald can also mean trivial or lame.bald conclusion. But waitwhos that waving to us?
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Yes, yes, Antipholus: look bewildered and frown at me. Youve given away all your sweet looks to some other womanI am not Adriana nor your wife. There was a time when youd freely tell me that words were never music to your ear unless I said them, that objects never pleased your eye unless I showed them to you, that touches never pleased your hands unless they were my touches, and that food never tasted sweet to you unless I had prepared it. How is it, my husbandoh, how is itthat you have become a stranger to yourself? I say yourself because you are a stranger to me now, but when we are indivisible and united in one body, I am better than the best part of you. Ah, dont tear yourself away from me! For you should know, my love, that it would be as easy to let a drop of water fall into the churning sea and then fish it out again, unmingled and undiminished, as it would be to take yourself from me without taking me out of myself as well. How deeply would it cut you if you heard that I had been cheating on you and that my bodywhich is sworn for you onlyhad been contaminated by vile lust?
</T>
<T>
Wouldnt you spit at me, and spurn me, and throw our marriage vows in my face? Wouldnt you tear the mark off my whorish foreheadWhores were commonly punished by being branded on the forehead.whorish forehead, cut the wedding ring off my finger, and swear to divorce me? I know you would, so go ahead. For I have, in fact, committed adultery, and my blood has been contaminated by lust. Because if marriage has made us one, then when you cheat, you poison my flesh as wellyour contagion makes me a prostitute. So stay faithful to me and return to your marriage bed.That way, my reputation will be protected and your honor will be intact.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Are you talking to me, fair woman? I dont know you. Ive only been in Ephesus for two hours. Your talk is as strange to me as your town. Im trying with all my wits to figure out what you mean, but I cant understand a word of it.

Shame on you, brother-in-law! Youve changed so much! Why are you treating my sister like this? She sent Dromio to bring you home for lunch.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Dromio?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Me?
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
You. And this is what you told me he said: that he beat you and pretended his house wasnt his and I wasnt his wife.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Did you talk with this woman? What kind of scheme do you have going together?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Me, sir? I never saw her till now.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
You liar! You said those exact things to me back in the marketplace.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I never talked with her in my life.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Then how does she know our names? By magic?
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
How distasteful! That a man of your stature would scheme with his servant to upset me like this. It may be my fault that youve been avoiding me, but dont make things worse by treating me with contempt as well. Ill hang on your sleeve: youre an elm tree, my husband, and Im a vine. My weakness is enhanced by your strength, which gives me the strength to say this: the things that take you away from me are worthlessjust overgrown weeds in need of a trimming. They get into your system and infect you, feeding off your confusion.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Shes talking to me. Shes talking about me. What, was I married to her in a dream? Or am I asleep now and imagining all this? What is making our eyes and ears act so strangely? Until I know for sure, Ill humor her.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Dromio, tell the servants to prepare for lunch.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Oh, I wish I had my rosary! Ill cross myself. This must be some kind of fairyland. Oh, spite of spites! Were
</T>
<T>
speaking with goblins, owls, and demons. If we dont obey them, theyll suck the life out of us or pinch us black and blue.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Why are you mumbling to yourself instead of answering the order I gave you? Dromio, you drone, you snail, you slug, you idiot!
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Ive been transformed somehow, havent I, master?
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I think your mind has been altered, and mine too.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
No, master, Ive been changed in both mind and body.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Your body looks the same.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
No, Im an apeape = a counterfeit (of myself); a foolape.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
If youve changed into anything, its an ass.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Thats true. Shes riding me hard, and all I want to do is get out of here. I must be as stupid as an assthats why I dont know her, but she knows me.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
All right, all right. I wont play the fool anymore and just cry while my husband and his man laugh at me. Come, husband, lets go to lunch. Dromio, guard the door. Husband, Ill eat with you in private today and hear your confession about all the pranks youve pulled. SirrahSirrah = term of address for a person of low social standingSirrah, if anyone asks where your master is, say hes out to lunch, and dont let anyone come in. Come, sister. Dromio, do a good job as doorkeeper.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Am I on earth, in heaven, or in hell? Asleep or awake? Crazy or sane? These people know me, but I dont
</T>
<T>
know myself! Ill agree with them and keep with it, whatever happens.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Master, should I watch the door?
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Yes, and dont let anyone come in, or else Ill break your head.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Come come, Antipholus. Were late for lunch.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Signior Angelo, please excuse us. My wife gets angry when Im late. Heres the story well tell her: that I was with you at your shop, watching you make her necklace, and that youre going to deliver it tomorrow. But here comes a scoundrel who says he saw me at the marketplace and that I beat on him, told him Id given him a thousand marks in gold, and then lied about my wife and my house. You drunkard, what was that all about?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Say what you want, but I know what I know. You beat me at the marketplace, and I have the bruises to prove it. If my skin were paper and your punches were ink, you could read the beating on my body.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
I think youre an ass.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Honestly, it sure looks that way, judging by all the beatings and the bad treatment Im getting. Since Im an ass, I ought to kick like one. Then youd be scared of me and keep away.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Signior Balthasar, you look upset. I hope the good meal Im going to give you will show the goodwill I bear you and how welcome you are.
</T>
<T>
BALTHASAR
Your delicacies arent worth as much to me as your welcome is.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Signior Balthasar, all the welcome in the world cant compare to a good meal, whatever kind of food it might be.
</T>
<T>
BALTHASAR
Good foods not a big dealeveryone can afford that.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
And everyone can say welcome, which is just a word.
</T>
<T>
BALTHASAR
A little food and a huge welcome makes a joyous feast.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Sure, to a cheap host and an even cheaper guest. But look, even if my dishes are poor, eat them with my best wishes. You may come across better food, but not a warmer welcome. Whats this? My door is locked. (to DROMIO) Tell them to let us in.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Maud, Bridget, Marian, Ciceley, Gillian, Ginn!
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
(from offstage) Dope, moron, eunuch, fool, idiot, clown! Either get away from the door or sit yourself down there! What, are you trying to summon women with your spellsis that why youre calling out so many names? Isnt one enough for you? Get away with you!
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
What clown did they hire as the new doorkeeper? My master is standing out in the street!
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
(from offstage) Then he should go back where he came from so he doesnt catch a cold.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Whos in there? Hey, open the door!
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
(from offstage) Right. Give me one good reason and I will.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
A reason? So I can eat lunch. I havent eaten today.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
(from offstage) And you wont eat here today. Come again some other time.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Who do you think you are, keeping me out of my own house?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
(from offstage) Im the doorkeeper for the moment, and my name is Dromio.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
You jerk! Youve stolen both my job and my name! True, the job never did me much good, and my name only ever got me in trouble. If you were the Dromio in my shoes today, you would have felt like you traded your head for a target and your name for the name of Ass.
</T>
<T>
LUCEIn a later printing of the play, the character of Luce was renamed Nell.LUCE
(from offstage) Whats all the commotion, Dromio? Whos at the door?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Luce, let my master in.
</T>
<T>
LUCE
(from offstage) No way, hes too late. Tell your master that.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Oh, Lord, this makes me laugh! Ill come at you with the old proverb: Should I make myself at home?
</T>
<T>
LUCE
(from offstage) Ill come at you with another: Id like to see you try it!
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
(from offstage) If your names Luce, then I say: Luce, good answer!
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Listen up, you slave. Are you going to let us in?
</T>
<T>
LUCE
(from offstage) I was going to ask you that question.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
(from offstage) But you already answered no.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Come, help me bang on the door, master. Well done! We answered them, blow for blow.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
You good-for-nothing, let me in.
</T>
<T>
LUCE
(from offstage) Says who?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Master, knock hard upon the door.
</T>
<T>
LUCE
(from offstage) He can knock till it hurts.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
If I break the door down, slave, youll be sorry for this.
</T>
<T>
LUCE
(from offstage) Why are we putting up with all this? The towns got a pair of stocksstocks = an instrument of public punishment. Offenders had their hands and feet locked in a wooden frame and were left to be mocked and abused.stocks.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
(from offstage) Whos making such a ruckus at the door?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
(from offstage) I swear, this towns plagued by troublesome boys.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Is that you, wife? You could have come sooner.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
(from offstage) Your wife, you scoundrel? Get away from the door.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
If she punishes you, master, shes sure to punish me.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
It looks like were not going to get food or welcome here.
</T>
<T>
BALTHASAR
We argued about which was best, and now we wont get either one.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Master, your guests are just standing here. Tell them theyre welcome.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Theres something strange in the air thats keeping us from getting in.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
And if your clothes were as thin as mine, youd really feel the air. The food inside is warm, but youre out here freezing. It would make any man as mad as a bull to be betrayed like this.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Go get me something I can use to break down the door.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
(from offstage) Break anything here and Ill break your head.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Ill break words with you, sir. And since words are just wind, Ill be breaking wind right in your face.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
(from offstage) It seems youre the one who needs to be broken. Be off with you, you dog!
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Ive had enough of this off with you! Come on, let me in!
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
(from offstage) Of coursewhen birds have no feathers and fish have no fins.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Well, Im going to break in. Go get me a crow.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
A crow without feathers? Master, do you really mean that? He said when fish have no fins, and you came back with a bird with no feathers. (to DROMIO OF SYRACUSE) If a crow gets us in, sirrah, then you and I will have a crow to pluck togethercrow to pluck together = score to settle with each othercrow to pluck together.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
I meant a crowbar. Get going already.
</T>
<T>
BALTHASAR
Be patient, sir! Dont do this! This will hurt your reputation and make your wife, whos innocent, look suspicious. Look, youve known her a long time. Shes wise, serious, mature, and modest. All this suggests that she has a good reason for doing this to you. Lets assume that she has a reason, which you dont know yet: have faith that shell eventually explain why she shut the doors on you today. Listen to me. Be patient and leave, and well all go to the Tiger for lunch. In the evening, come back alone and figure out this strange resistance. If you get violent and break in now, in broad daylight, people will talk about it. The common mob will presume things, and your untarnished reputation will be damagedand that damage will last long after youre dead. Slander passes from generation to generation, and once it sticks to a family, its there forever.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Youre rightIll go quietly. And even though Im in a distasteful mood, Ill work on being happy. I know a terrific wench. Shes beautiful and charminga little wild, but also gentle. Well eat at her place. My wife has accused me more than once of misbehaving with this woman. I swear to her that I havent, but it doesnt change anything. Well go to her place for lunch. (to ANGELO) Go get the necklace, which Im sure is done by now. Bring it to the Porcupine, where this woman is. Ill to give it to her, just to spite my wife. Hurry, good sir. Since my own doors refuse to admit me, Ill knock somewhere else and see if they turn me away as well.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Ill meet you there in an hour.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Do that. This little prank of hers is going to cost me.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Have you completely forgotten your duty as a husband? Antipholus, your marriage is still fresh and new, like the springtimehave the young shoots of your love already started to wither? Is the building of your love already in ruins? If you married my sister for her wealth, then for her wealths sake, treat her with more kindness. Or if your affection has already strayed to another woman, at least be stealthy about it. Hide your false love, blindfold yourself so my sister cannot read your faithlessness in your eyes. Watch what you say, and dont let your own words give away your shame. Look sweet and act kindlybe attractive in your disloyalty. Disguise your misbehavior as integrity, and behave properly even if your heart is tainted. Though you are sinful, carry yourself like a holy saint. Be false in secret: why does she need to know? What foolish thief brags about his crimes? Its doubly wrong to cheat on your wife and then let her see the offense in your eyes. When you do something shameful, its possible to put a good spin on it, but bad deeds are made worse by speaking of them. Alas, poor women! Were so gullible, we believe it when you say you love us. Even if you love someone else in your heart, make it appear as if you love us. We follow in your orbit, and you have the power to move us. So, my sweet brother-in-law, go inside. Comfort my sister, cheer her up, call her wife. Its a holy thing to lie a little when sweet flattery can smooth over trouble.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Sweet mistressI dont know what other name to give you, or how youve figured out mineyou seem as
</T>
<T>
wise and graceful as the earth is wonderful and divine. Teach me how I should think and speak. My understanding is clumsy and human, riddled with errorsit is feeble, shallow, and weak. Reveal to me the hidden meaning of your words. Why would you have me betray the truth of my emotions and make my love wander in some other direction? Are you a god? Are you trying to remake me? Go ahead, Ill yield to your power. But if I am myself, then I know for sure that your weeping sister is not my wife. I dont owe her any dutyits you that I submit to. Oh, sweet mermaid, dont command me to drown myself in the flood of your sisters tears. Sirensirens = mermaids of Greek myth who lured men to their death with their singingSiren, use your song to make me love you instead, and I will obey. Spread your golden hair over the silver waves, and I will lie down in it like a bed. If a man could dieTo die also has the suggestion to orgasm.die in that glorious fantasy, then I think he would benefit by dying. Love is light and therefore floatsif my love is false, let me sink!

LUCIANA
Are you insane, talking like this?
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Not insane, but amazed. I dont know how.In the original Shakespearean line, mated can mean both overthrown and married.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Your eyes are playing tricks on you.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Thats because you are near me, and youre as dazzling as the sun.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Train your eye on what you should be looking at, and youll see straight again.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Sweet love, Id rather close my eyes than look at darkness.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Why are you calling me love? Call my sister that.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Your sisters sister.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Thats my sister.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
No, its you: my better half. My eyes clear vision, my hearts most precious desire. My food, my fortune, my sweetest hope, my heaven on earth, and my entrance to heaven.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
My sister is all those things, or else she should be.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Call yourself your own sister, because I want you. I will love you, and with you Ill spend my life. You have no husband yet, and I have no wife. Give me your hand.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Oh, wait, sir. Stay here. Ill go get my sister and see what she thinks.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Whats going on, Dromio? Where are you running so fast?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Do you know me? Am I Dromio? Am I your servant? Am I myself?
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
You are Dromio, you are my servant, and you are yourself.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Im an ass, Im a womans servant, and Im beside myself.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What womans servant? What do you mean, beside yourself?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Ill tell you. Besides belonging to myself, I belong to a woman. A woman who says she owns me, who wont leave me alone, and who wants me.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
How does she claim to own you?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
The same way a person would claim to own his horse. And she wants me as a beast. I dont mean that she wants me because Im a beast, but that she, who is a beast, says I belong to her.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Whats she like?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
She has a very significant body. You couldnt even talk about it without saying, I beg your pardon.i.e., youd have to say I beg your pardon when talking about her body because youd have to use obscene language to discuss it.I beg your pardon. My luck would be running thin if I ended up with her, although shed make it a fat marriage.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What do you mean, a fat marriage?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Sir, she works in the kitchen, so shes oily. The only thing I could do with her is to use all that oil as fuel in a lamp and then use that light to run away by. Her

<T>
clothes are so oily, theyd burn through the longest winter. Even if she lives till the end of the world, shed keep burning an additional week.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Whats her skin like?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Its dark, like my shoe. But its not as clean. Youd be up to your ankles in how filthy it is.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Some water will fix that.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
No, its permanent. Noahs flood wouldnt be enough water to clean it.

Whats her name?

So shes wide?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Her hips are as wide as she is tall. Shes round, like a globe. I could use her like a map to find out where countries are.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What part of her body is Ireland?

Wheres France?

In her foreheadAt the time this play was written, there had recently been a rebellion against the heir to Frances throne. Since Nell is going bald, Dromio puns that her forehead is like France, rebelling against her hair (or heir).forehead, which is enormous because of her receding hairline.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Oh, sir, I didnt look down there. In conclusion, this witch said I was hers. She called me Dromio and swore Id promised to marry her. She knew private things about my body, like the birthmark on my shoulder, the mole on my neck, and the huge wart on my left arm. I was terrified, and I ran away from her as if she were a witch. And I think that if I hadnt been brave and strong, she would have turned me into a dog and made me her slave.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Get goinghustle over to the port. If theres enough wind for a ship to sail out tonight, I wont spend tonight in this town. If a ships leaving, come to the marketplace. Ill wait there for you. If everyone here knows us but we dont know anybody, its time, I think, for us to pack our bags and take off.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Ill run from this woman who claims to be my wife as fast as Id run from a bear.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Everyone who lives here is a witch. That means its high time for me to go. That woman who claims I am her husbandI loathe her in my soul. But her gorgeous sister, whos so lovely and gracious, whos so charming and who speaks so well,

almost makes me want to stay here against my better judgment. Id better stop up my ears against this sirens song.

Yes, thats my name.
</T>

ANGELO
I know that, sir. Look, heres the necklace.
I was on my way to take it to you at the Porcupine, but it took a little longer to finish than I thought it would.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What do you want me to do with this?
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Whatever you wantI made it for you.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Made it for me? I didnt order it.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
You didnot just once or twice, but twenty times. Take it home and make your wife happy. Ill come over at suppertime and you can pay me for it then.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
You should take the money now. If you dont, you might never see the money or the necklace ever again.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Youre a funny man, sir. Take care.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I dont know what to think about this. But what I do think is that nobody in his right mind would refuse to accept such a beautiful necklace when somebody offers it. I
</T>
<T>
guess theres no need to be a thief in Ephesus.
People come up to you in the street and hand you gold. Ill go wait for Dromio at the marketplace. If any ships are sailing, Ill get right on one.
</T>
<T>
SECOND MERCHANT
Youve owed me this money since the Pentecost holiday. I havent pressed you for it, and I wouldnt now except that Im going to Persia and I need money for the trip. So pay me now, or Ill have this officer arrest you.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Antipholus owes me the exact amount that I owe you. Just before I ran into you, I gave him a necklace. At five o'clock hes going to pay me for it. Please, come to his house with me. Ill pay what I owe you then and say thank you as well.
</T>
<T>
OFFICER
He saves you the trouble: look, here he comes.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
(to DROMIO) Im going to the jewelers house. You go buy a piece of ropeIll whip my wife and her cohorts for locking me out of my own house. Wait a minute! I see the jeweler. Go, be gone with you. Buy a rope and bring it to me.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I buy myself a thousand beatings a year if I buy a rope.
Theres no consensus about the exact meaning of this obscure line, which is an expression of Dromios frustration.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
(to ANGELO) Good luck to any man who trusts you. I swore that you would come with the necklace, but neither you nor the necklace showed up. Perhaps you were concerned about being chained to me and so decided not to come.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
All joking aside, heres an invoice spelling out exactly how many carats the necklace weighs as well as the quality of the gold and the workmanship. The total due is about three ducats more than I owe this gentleman. Please, pay him immediately. Hes about to leave on a trip and hes waiting for the money.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
I dont have the cash right now. Besides, I have some business to take care of in town. Good signior, take this stranger to my house. Bring the necklace with you, and tell my wife to pay you the amount due. I might make it back in time to meet you.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
So youll bring the necklace to her yourself?
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
No. You bring it in case I cant make it.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
All right, sir, I will. Do you have it with you?
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
If I dont, I hope you do. Or else youll leave without your money.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Listen, please, give me the necklace. This gentlemans ready to go. The wind is right and its high tide, and Ive delayed him a long time already.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Good Lord! Youre using this as an excuse for not showing up at the Porcupine like you promised. I should have reprimanded you then for not bringing it, but you started fighting with me first.
</T>
<T>
SECOND MERCHANT
Its getting late. Please, sir, hurry up.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Antipholus, you hear how the man pleads with me. Give me the necklace!
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Give it to my wife, and get your money.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Come, come. You know I gave it to you just now. Send the necklace to her, or send me with a token that will authorize her to pay me.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Damn it, this isnt funny. Wheres the necklace? Let me see it.
</T>
<T>
SECOND MERCHANT
My business cannot wait for this delay. (to ANTIPHOLUS) Good sir, tell me if youre going to pay me. If not, Ill turn this man over to the officer.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Pay you? What should I pay you?
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
The money you owe me for the necklace.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
I owe you nothing until I receive the necklace.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
You know that I gave it to you a half hour ago.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
You gave me nothing, and you wrong me by saying you did.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
You wrong me even more, sir, by denying it. Consider how poorly this reflects on me.
</T>
<T>
SECOND MERCHANT
Well, officer, I charge you to arrest him.
</T>
<T>
OFFICER
I will. (to ANGELO) And I order you to obey me, in the name of the duke.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
This harms my reputation. Either pay this sum, Antipholus, or Ill have this officer arrest you.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Pay for something I never got? Go ahead, you fool. Arrest me if you dare.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Officer, heres your feearrest him. I would have my own brother arrested if he treated me so terribly.
</T>
<T>
OFFICER
Youre under arrest, sir. You hear the charges.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Ill obey you until I can make bail. But Angelo, youll pay for this, even if it costs all the precious metals in your jewelry shop.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Sir, the laws of Ephesus will be on my side, and youll be embarrassed. Im certain of it.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Master, theres a ship from Epidamnum thats going to set sail as soon as its owner gets on board. Ive left our luggage on the ship, and I bought the oil, balm, and liquor you wanted. The ship is ready, the wind is up, and the sailors are only waiting for their owner and for you.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
What are you, a madman? You annoying idiot, what Epidamnum ship is waiting for me?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
A ship you sent me to find, to book passage out of here.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
You drunken slave, I sent you for a rope, and I told you what to do with it.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Yeah, rightyou sent me to get whipped. You sent me to the port to find a ship.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Ill debate this with you later, and then Ill teach you to listen more carefully. Go to Adriana, you scoundrel, and quickly. Give her this key, and tell her that theres money in the desk thats covered with a Turkish tapestry. Have her send it to me. Tell her that Ive been arrested and the money will be my bail. Hurry, you slave! Go! Officer, take me to prison until the money comes.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
To Adriana? Thats where we had lunch. Where that sweetheart said I was her husband! Shes too much for me to handle. But I must go there, against my will: servants must fulfill their masters' wishes.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Oh, Luciana, did he tempt you like that? Could you tell from his face if he was serious? Yes or no? Did he look flushed or pale? Sad or happy? Could you tell from his looks what he was feeling in his heart?
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
First, he said you had no right to him.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
He meant he did nothing right for mewhich is true, unfortunately.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Then he swore he was a stranger here.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
And thats truehe is being strange. And yet he lies as well, for hes no stranger.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Then I pleaded for you.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
And what did he say?
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
That he felt for me the love that I begged him to feel for you.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
How did he try to persuade you to love him?
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
With words thatif they were spoken honestlymight have moved me. First, he praised my beauty, then my eloquence.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Did you praise him as well?
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Have some patience, please.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
I cannot and I will not keep quiet. My voice will have its way, even if my heart cant. He is misshapen, crooked, old, and withered. His face is ugly, and his body is even worseall shapeless, everywhere. He is vicious, mean, foolish, blunt, unkind. His body is deformed, and his mind is worse.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Then why be jealous of a person like that? When an evil thing has been lost, no one cries.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Oh, but I think of him more highly than I say I doand I wish he looked worse in other womens eyes. Im like a lapwing, creating a diversion in order to distract predators from my nest. My heart adores him, even though my tongue curses him.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Here! Go! The desk! Money! Come on, now! Hurry!
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
How did you lose your breath?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
By running fast.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Wheres your master, Dromio? Is he all right?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
No, hes in a place worse than hell. A devil in a tough uniform has hima man whose heart is as hard as steel. A fiend and a goblin, pitiless and rough. A wolfno, even worsea man all in tough leather. A backbiting friend, one who grabs people, who patrols the streets and passageways. A hunting dog that runs in
</T>
<T>
the opposite direction of its prey, yet can follow the scent of the hunt. A man who puts people away before the verdict is announced.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Speak, man, whats the matter?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I dont know what the matter is, but hes been arrested for it.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
What? Hes been arrested? Tell me, who had him arrested?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I dont know who had him arrested, but the man that arrested him was in a suit of leather. Mistress, will you send him bail? The money in the desk?
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Get it, sister.
</T>
<T>
I dont understand it. How could he be in debt without me knowing it? Tell me, was he arrested because of a bandA band is a bond or debt. Dromio hears another meaning: a band of fabric.band?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Not for a band, but for something stronger: a necklace, a necklace! Dont you hear it ring?
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
What, the necklace?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
No, no, the bell. Its time for me to go. It was two o'clock when I left him, and now its one.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Times running backward? Ive never heard of that.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Oh, sure. When an hourIn Shakespeares time, hour could sound like ower (someone who owes money) or even whore, both of whom would run from policemen.hour meets a cop, it turns and runs in fear.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Times not the one in debt. Your logic is so foolish.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Time is always bankrupt: it owes more than it can ever pay back in a season. And Times a thief, toodont you know the old saying, Time steals along? So if Time is in debt and also a thief, and a cop comes, dont you think Time would turn back an hour?
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Heres the money, Dromio. Take it to your master and bring him home immediately. Come, sister, my imagination is too much for me: it both comforts me and depresses me.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Every person I meet greets me like an old friend, and every one of them knows my name. Some of them give me money, some invite me places, some thank me for the kind things Ive done for them, some try to sell me things. Just now a tailor showed me fabrics he bought especially for me and then started to take my measurements. These are tricks of the imagination, and this place is filled with magicians.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Heres the money you wanted, master. Hey, have you gotten rid of that AdamDromio calls the officer Adam because, after Adam and Eve were expelled from Eden, Adam wore clothing made of skins, llike the officers leather uniform.Adam?
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What gold is this? Whos this Adam you speak of?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Not the Adam from the garden of Eden, but the Adam from the jailhouse. The one that wears leather clothes. The one that grabbed you and arrested you.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I dont know what youre talking about.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
No? Its plain enough. The Adam who looks like a cello, in a big leather case. The one who gives tired people arrest. The one who gives ruined men new suitslaw suits. The one whos determined to do more damage with his nightstick than a soldier does with his pike.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
You mean an officer?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Yes, the leader of the team; the one that gets you if you cant pay a debt; the one who assumes people are always going to bed and says to them, Have arrest.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Well, sir, stop your joking there. Are any ships leaving tonight? Can we go?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Why, sir, I told you an hour ago that the good ship Expedition was leaving tonight, but then the officer got you, and you decided to wait for the little rowboat Delay. Heres the bail money you sent me to get.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
This fellows gone mad, and so have I. Were in some kind of dream world. Please, somebody, get us out of here!
</T>
<T>
COURTESAN
Good to see you, Master Antipholus. I see youve met with the jeweler. Is that chain youre wearing the one you promised to give to me?
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Get away from me, Satan! Dont try to tempt me!
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Master, is this Satans mistress?
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Shes the devil.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
No, shes worse: shes the devils mother, and she comes to us disguised as an easy wench. And thats why some women say, God damn me, which is the same thing as saying, God make me an easy wench. The Bible says the devil looks like an angel of light. But fire also gives off light, and fire will burn you. In other words, easy wenches will burn you. Keep away from this one.
</T>
<T>
COURTESAN
You and your servant are very funny, sir. Will you come with me? Can we finish our lunch?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Master, if you eat with her, bring really long silverware.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Why, Dromio?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Because of the old saying: He who eats with the devil needs a very long spoon. You need to keep far away from them.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
(to COURTESAN) Get away, you demon! You talk about eating? Youre a sorceress, like everyone else here. Ill conjure you, like a spell: get away from me.
</T>
<T>
COURTESAN
Give me back the ring I gave you at lunch, or give me the necklace you promised in exchange. Then Ill be gone, sir, and stop troubling you.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Some devilsIn Revelation 20:1, an angel descends from heaven with a chain to bind the devil with.devils ask for nothing more than nail clippings, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin, a nut, or a cherry pit. But this ones greedy: she wants a necklace. Be wise, master. If you give it to her, shell shake the chain and frighten us, like the angel in the Bible.
</T>
<T>
COURTESAN
Now listen, either give me my ring or give me the necklace. I hope youre not trying to cheat me.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Be gone, witch! Come, Dromio, lets go.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Accusing us of cheating is like the proud peacock accusing someone else of pride. Mistress, you know about that.
</T>
<T>
COURTESAN
Antipholus has gone insane, no question about it. If not, hed never behave like this. He has a ring of mine, worth forty ducats, and he promised to give me a necklace in exchange for it. Now he wont give me either. The reason I think hes insane, besides the way he just acted, is that he told a senseless story over lunch about being locked out of his own house. His wife probably did it on purpose because she knows what kind of fits hes having. I must go to his house and tell his wife that he came bursting into my place like a lunatic and stole my ring. Its my best option: I cant afford to lose forty ducats.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Dont worry, man, I wont try to escape. When its time for me to be freed, Ill pay you the fee youre entitled to for arresting me. My wifes in a perverse mood today. Shell be suspicious when the messenger tells her that I was arrested. I tell you, this will make her angry when she hears about it.
</T>
<T>
Heres my servant. I think hes got the money. Hello there, sir! Do you have what I told you to get?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Yes. And this rope will take care of everybody, I guarantee it.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
But wheres the money?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Why, sir, I spent it on this rope.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
You idiot! Five hundred ducats for a rope?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I can get you five hundred ropes for that price.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Why did I just send you home?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
To get a piece of rope. And here I am, with that piece.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
And Ill use that piece of rope to welcome you with. (beats DROMIO OF EPHESUS)
</T>
<T>
OFFICER
Good sir, calm down.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
You should tell me to calm downIm the one whos suffering here.
</T>
<T>
OFFICER
Hold your tongue.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
No, you should tell him to hold his hands!
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
You son of a bitch, senseless villain!
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I wish I were senseless, sir, so that I wouldnt feel your punches!
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
The only thing you can sense are punchesjust like an ass.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I am an ass, indeed: you can tell by my long ears. Ive served this man from the moment I was born until this very instant, and all Ive ever gotten from him are bruises. When Im cold, his beatings keep me warm. When Im hot, they keep me cool. He wakes me up by beating me, makes me stand by beating me, sends me out of the house and welcomes me back by beating me. Seriously, I carry beatings around with me like a beggar woman carries her baby. I figure that once hes crippled me, Ill beg by showing off my beatings.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Thats enough. My wifes coming.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Mistress, think about your endbeware of your death! Or as the parrot says: Beware of the ropes end, and watch out for a hanging.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Are you going to keep talking? (beats DROMIO OF
EPHESUS)
</T>
<T>
COURTESAN
Now what do you think? Your husbands mad, isnt he?
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
This terrible behavior proves it. Doctor Pinch, youre an exorcist. If you can bring him back to his senses, Ill pay you whatever you demand.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Alas, how passionate and angry he looks!
</T>
<T>
COURTESAN
Look! Hes trembling in his fit!
</T>
<T>
PINCH
Give me your hand. Let me take your pulse.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Heres my hand. Let it feel your ear. (he strikes PINCH)
</T>
<T>
PINCH
Satan! You are living inside this man! I order you to release him through my prayers and to return immediately to the darkness you came from. I demand this in the name of all the saints in heaven.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Shut up, you doddering old wizard! Im not possessed!
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Oh, I wish you werent, you poor, frightened soul.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Listen, hussyis this man one of your customers? Did this fool with the yellow face feast and celebrate in my house today while the guilty doors shut in my face and locked me out of my own house?
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Oh, husband, God himself knows you ate at home. I wish you had stayed there, avoiding these scandals and this public embarrassment!
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Ate at home? You there, rogue, what do you have to say about that?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I swear, sir, you did not eat at home.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
My doors were locked and I was shut out, right?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
By God, your doors were locked and you were shut out.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
And she screamed at me, right?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
No lieshe screamed at you.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
And her cook yelled, mocked, and teased me, right?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
She sure did. The kitchen girl mocked you.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
And I departed in a rage, right?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
You truly did. My body can prove it because it felt the power of your anger.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
(to PINCH) Should I try to soothe him by pretending to agree with his lies?
</T>
<T>
PINCH
Good idea. His servant here has figured out that agreeing is a good way to cope with his anger.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
(to ADRIANA) You convinced the jeweler to arrest me.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
For goodness sake, I sent money to bail you out. I gave it to Dromio, who rushed in for it.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
You gave money to me? She might have given me her best wishes, master, but she didnt give me one scrap of money.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Didnt you go to her for a purse full of ducats?
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
He did, and I gave it to him.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
And I saw her do it.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I was sent for a rope! God and the rope maker are my witnesses!
</T>
<T>
PINCH
Mistress, both the man and his master are possessed. I can tell by how pale and deathlike they look. We must tie them up and leave them in some dark room.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
(to ADRIANA) Tell me! Why did you lock me out today? (to DROMIO OF EPHESUS) And why are you denying that you received the gold?
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
My sweet husband, I did not lock you out.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
And my sweet master, I received no gold. But I agree, sir, that we were locked out.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
You lying villain! Both those statements are false.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
You lying slut, everything you say is false. Youre scheming with some damned gang, trying to make a fool of me. With my own bare hands, Ill scratch out your eyes, which want to see me humiliated.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Tie him up! Tie him up! Keep him away from me!
</T>
<T>
PINCH
We need more help! The devil in him is strong!
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Oh, my, poor man! How pale and listless he looks!
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Are you trying to kill me? jailer, im your prisoner. are you going to let them break me out of jail?
</T>
<T>
OFFICER
Gentlemen, let go of him. Hes my prisoner and you cant have him.
</T>
<T>
PINCH
Tie up the servant, for he is mad as well.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
What are you doing, you stupid officer? Do you take some kind of pleasure in seeing a sick man harm himself?
</T>
<T>
OFFICER
Hes my prisoner. If I let him go, Ill have to pay his bail fees myself.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Ill pay you. Take me to the man my husband is in debt to. Once I find out what the debt is for, Ill pay it. Doctor Pinch, please have him brought to my house. What a horrible day!
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
What a horrible slut!
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Master, Im all tied up for you.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Shut up already, you scoundrel! Why are you trying to provoke me?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Youd rather be tied up for nothing? Act insane, good master: scream out, The devil!
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Oh my God! The poor soulshow strangely they talk!
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Get him out of here. Sister, come with me.
</T>
<T>
Now tell me. Who had him arrested?
</T>
<T>
OFFICER
Angelo, the jeweler. Do you know him?
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
I know him. How much does my husband owe?
</T>
<T>
OFFICER
Two hundred ducats.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
For what?
</T>
<T>
OFFICER
For a necklace your husband had him make.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
He said he was going to buy me a necklace, but I never saw it.
</T>
<T>
COURTESAN
Today your husband came to my place, completely furious. He took my ring, which I just saw on his finger, by the way. Right after that, I saw him with a necklace.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Maybe so, but I never saw it. Jailer, bring me to the jeweler. I need to hear the truth about all this.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
God have mercy on us! They broke loose!
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
And theyve got their swords unsheathed! Lets call for help and get them tied up again!
</T>
<T>
OFFICER
Lets get out of here! Theyll kill us!
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
It looks like these witches are scared of swords.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
The one who claims to be your wife just ran away from you.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Go to the Centaur and get our stuff. I wish we were safely on board our ship already.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Look, lets stay here tonight. Nobody will hurt us. You see how kind everyone is to us, how they just hand us gold. I think this country is so kind that if it werent for
</T>
<T>
that mountain of insanity that wants to marry me, I could find it in my heart to stay here and become a witch myself.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I wouldnt stay here tonight for the entire town. Go and get our stuff onto the ship.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Im sorry that I delayed you, sir. But even though he denies it, I swear he got the necklace from me.
</T>
<T>
SECOND MERCHANT
Whats this mans reputation like here in the city?
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
People think very highly of him. The merchants give him unlimited credit. Hes well beloved, second to none in the city. Id trust him with everything I own.
</T>
<T>
SECOND MERCHANT
Speak more quietly: I think hes coming this way.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Youre right. And that necklace around his neck is the very one he swore he didnt have! Good sir, stay close to me. Ill speak to him. Signior Antipholus, I cant believe youd put me to this kind of shame and troublenot to mention the scandal youve brought on yourself. You swore I never gave you the necklace, but now youre wearing it openly. Not only has your lie cost you money, shame, and imprisonment, but youve also mistreated this honest friend of mine. If it hadnt been for this dispute, he would have already hoisted sail and left for sea. You got that necklace from me: can you deny that?
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I got it from youI never said I didnt.
</T>
<T>
SECOND MERCHANT
Yes, you did, sir. In fact, you swore it.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Who heard me do that?
</T>
<T>
SECOND MERCHANT
My own ears heard it, and you know it. To hell with you! Its a shame that you walk the streets with all the honest men.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Youre a villain to say this about me. Ill prove that Im an honest man and a man of honor if you dare defend yourself.
</T>
<T>
SECOND MERCHANT
I do dare, and I say that you are the villain.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
(to SECOND MERCHANT) Wait! Dont hurt him, for Gods sake! Hes crazy! Somebody approach him and take away his sword. Tie up Dromio, too, and take them to my house.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Run, master, run. For Gods sake, find a house to duck into. This looks like an abbey. Go in, or were done for.
</T>
<T>
ABBESS
Be quiet, people! Why have you come here in such a mob?
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
To get my poor, mad husband out from inside there. Let us in so we can tie him up tight and bring him home to recover.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
(to SECOND MERCHANT) I knew he wasnt quite in his right mind.
</T>
<T>
SECOND MERCHANT
(to ANGELO) Now Im sorry I raised my sword against him.
</T>
<T>
ABBESS
How long has he been possessed like this?
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
This week he was sad, moody, and depressed and very different from his usual self. But it wasnt until this afternoon that he broke out into violence.
</T>
<T>
ABBESS
Did he lose a lot of money in a shipwreck? Has a close friend of his died? Has he fallen in love with another woman? Thats a sin young men often commit because they allow their eyes to wander. Which of these bad things happened to him?
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
None of them, except the last one. He fell in love, and that made him leave home often.
</T>
<T>
ABBESS
You should have reprimanded him for that.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
I did.
</T>
<T>
ABBESS
Fine, but you werent harsh enough.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
I was as harsh as I could be while still being a lady.
</T>
<T>
ABBESS
You scolded him in private?
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
And in public too.
</T>
<T>
ABBESS
Fine, but not enough.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
It was all we talked about. I kept him awake at night talking about it. He couldnt eat without me talking about it. When we were alone, it was the only thing I talked about, and when we were with other people, I often found a way to mention it. All I ever did was tell him how hurtful and bad it was.
</T>
<T>
ABBESS
And thats why he went crazy. A jealous womans poisonous ranting is worse than the bite of a rabid dog. You disturbed his sleep with your complaining, which is why hes disoriented. You seasoned his food with screams. Stress during mealtime ruins the digestion, and that gave him a raging fever. Fever, as we know, is a kind of madness. You spoiled his fun by fighting with him, and when people cant enjoy themselves, they grow moody and dull with melancholythey come very close to being grim and cheerlessly depressed. Next thing you know, all kinds of terrible illnesses break out. Ruining his meals, his enjoyment, and his sleep would drive any man or beast mad. What Im saying is, your jealousy has pushed your husband away from his sanity.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
She was always gentle when she scolded him, even when he behaved in the worst and wildest ways. (to ADRIANA) Why wont you defend yourself against this woman?
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
She has tricked me into seeing my own faults. Gentlemen, go in there and grab him.
</T>
<T>
ABBESS
Nobody goes into my house!
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Then have your servants bring him out.
</T>
<T>
ABBESS
No: he came here for sanctuaryIn Shakespeares period, people who sought protection in churches and other holy places were considered outside the reach of the law.sanctuary, and that will protect him from you. Ill try to bring him back to his right mind and work to the end of my abilities to do so.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Its my place to take care of my husband and nurse him back to health. It is my duty and mine alone. So let me take him home.
</T>
<T>
ABBESS
Be patient. Im not going to let him leave until Ive tried every means to cure him. With my healthful potions, drugs, and holy prayers, Ill make him a complete man again. Healing is part and parcel of my religious vows; it is a charitable duty my order performs. Therefore, depart, and leave him here with me.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
I will not depart and leave my husband here. It doesnt suit your holiness to separate a husband and his wife.
</T>
<T>
ABBESS
Be quiet and depart. Youre not going to take him.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Go lodge a complaint about this with the duke.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Come with me. Ill fall at his feet and lie there until my pleading and crying convinces the duke to come here and force my husband to leave this abbey.
</T>
<T>
SECOND MERCHANT
Its almost five o'clock. The duke will pass by here soon. He always passes here on his way to that melancholy place where criminals are put to death. Its just behind this abbey.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Why is he going there today?
</T>
<T>
SECOND MERCHANT
To see an elderly, unlucky merchant from Syracuse publicly beheaded for breaking the law and coming here to Ephesus.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Here they come. We will watch the execution.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Kneel down to the duke before he passes by the abbey.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
One more time, we proclaim this publicly: If anyone will pay this mans bail, he will not be put to death. This is how well we regard him.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Duke, the abbess has wronged me and I seek justice.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Shes a virtuous and holy lady. She cant possibly have done you any wrong.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Your Highness, you were the one who introduced me to my husband, Antipholus, and suggested I marry him. On this terrible day, a most outrageous fit of madness possessed him. It made him run desperately through the streets with his servant, who is just as mad. He angered all the citizens by rushing into their houses and taking rings, jewels, and anything else he felt like. At one point I managed to get him tied up and sent home so that I could make some order out of all the trouble he caused. But somehow, he broke free from his guards. Then he and his crazy servant found us and chased us away with swords. We got more help and came back to capture them, but then they fled into this abbey. We tried to go in, but the abbess stopped us. She wouldnt let us get him and she wouldnt send him out. So please, most gracious duke, order her to bring him out so we can get him some help.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
A long time ago your husband was a soldier in the wars I led. And when you married him and made him the master of your bed, I gave you my word that I would do everything I possibly could for him.
</T>
<T>
(to his followers) Go, knock on the gate and bid the abbess come out here and speak to me. Ill settle this before I go
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
Mistress! Run and save yourself. My master and his servant broke loose. Theyve beaten the maids and tied up Doctor Pinch. Then they set fire to his beard and threw sewage to put out the flames. My master keeps telling the doctor to relax, while his servant cuts the doctors hair in a ridiculous fashion. If you dont send some help, theyll kill Doctor Pinch.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Shut up, fool! Your master and his servant are here. Youre telling a lie.
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
Mistress, I swear on my life that its true. It was just moments ago. Hes crying out for you and swears hell burn your face and disfigure you if he can get ahold of you.
</T>
<T>
Listen, listen! I hear him, mistress. Run, get out of here!
</T>
<T>
DUKE
(to ADRIANA) Stand with me. Dont be scared. (to his men) Guards, get your weapons!
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Oh, my, its my husband. Look, he can become invisible. Just now we put him in the abbey over here, and now hes over there. Its impossible to understand.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Justice, gracious duke. Please bring me justice! A long time ago I did good service to you. I fought in your wars and took deep wounds to save your life. In exchange for the blood I shed for you then, I ask you for justice now.
</T>
<T>
EGEON
(to himself) The fear of death might be making me senile, but I think I see my son Antipholus, and Dromio.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Sweet prince, I want justice from that woman there. This woman that you urged me to marry has abused me and dishonored me, doing the most injury possible. The things she has shamelessly hurled on me are beyond imagination.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Tell me the details. You know Ill be fair.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Today, great duke, she locked me out of my house and feasted there with whores.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Thats terrible! (to ADRIANA) Tell us, woman, did you do that?
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
No, my good lord. I ate with him and my sister. Damn my soul if these accusations are true!
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
If shes lying, I pray that I never sleep again at night or wake up during the day.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Oh, lying woman! Both of them are liars: the madman accuses them justly.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
My lord, I know what Im saying. Im not drunk, and I havent gone mad from angereven though the wrongs done to me today would drive any man insane. This woman locked me out of the house today at lunchtime, and if he werent conspiring with her, this jeweler could confirm my story since he was with me at the time. He left to fetch a necklace and he promised to bring it to the Porcupine, where I was dining with Balthasar. He hadnt arrived by the time we finished eating, so I went out looking for him. I met him in the streethe was there with that man. (points to the SECOND MERCHANT)
Thats when this lying jeweler swore that he had already given me the necklace, which, God knows, he hadnt. He had me arrested for it, and I went with the officer, sending my servant home to get money for the bail. When my servant returned empty-handed, I politely asked the officer to accompany me to my house. On the way, we came across my wife, her sister, and their gang of vile associates.
One of them was a man named Pinch: a hungry, narrow-faced villain; a skeleton; a fraud; a raggedy magician and fortune-teller; a needy, hollow-eyed, emaciated wretch; a walking corpse. He pretended to be some kind of sorcerer, and he gazed in my eyes and took my pulse. Then, with his thin face leering down at mine, he cried out that I was possessed.
</T>
<T>
Then they all pounced on me, tied me up, carried me away, and left me in a dark, dank cellar in my house. They left me and my servant there, tied together. Eventually I chewed through the ropes and freed myself, and I immediately ran to find you, Your Grace. I beg you: grant me justice for the deep shame I have suffered and the terrible wrongs done to me.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Your Highness, I can confirm this much: he was locked out of his house and didnt eat at home.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
But did he receive a necklace from you?
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
He did, my lord. And when he ran in here, everyone could see that he was wearing that necklace.
</T>
<T>
SECOND MERCHANT
Besides, Ill swear I heard you confess that you did receive the necklace, even after you swore at the marketplace that you hadnt. Thats when I raised my sword against you, and you fled into this abbeywhich, I think, you must have escaped from through some kind of trick.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
I was never inside this abbey, and you never raised your sword against me. I never saw the necklace, so help me heaven! Everything you charge me with is untrue.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Why, what a complicated case this is! I think you all must have drunk some kind of potion thats turned you all into animals. (to ADRIANA) If you put him in the abbey, thats where hed be. If he were insane, he wouldnt be pleading his case so sensibly. You say he
</T>
<T>
ate at home, but the jeweler says he didnt. SirrahSirrah = term of address for a person of low social standingSirrah, what do you have to say?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Sir, he ate with this woman at the Porcupine.
</T>
<T>
COURTESAN
He did, and he snatched my ring right off my finger.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Thats true, my lord: I did get this ring from her.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Did you see him enter this abbey?
</T>
<T>
COURTESAN
As clearly as I see you, my lord.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
This is very odd. Get the abbess out here. I think youre all either bewildered or stark raving mad.
</T>
<T>
EGEON
Mighty duke, please allow me to say something. I think I see a friend who will pay my bail and save my life.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Feel free to say what you wish, Syracusian.
</T>
<T>
EGEON
(to ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS) Isnt your name Antipholus? And isnt that Dromio, the man bound to you?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I was bound to him an hour ago, sir, but thankfully he chewed through our ropes. Now Im Dromio and no longer attached to him.
</T>
<T>
EGEON
Im sure you both remember me.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Actually, its ourselves you bring to mind since just a few moments ago we were tied up, as you are now. Youre not one of Pinchs patients, are you, sir?
</T>
<T>
EGEON
Why are you looking at me so strangely? You know me well.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
I never saw you before in my life.
</T>
<T>
EGEON
Oh, grief has transformed me since the last time you saw me. Time has the power to deform people, and the sorrowful hours I have spent in his company have put these strange lines and wrinkles on my face. But tell me this: dont you know my voice?
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
No.
</T>
<T>
EGEON
Dont you, Dromio?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
No sir, trust me, I do not.
</T>
<T>
EGEON
I am sure you do.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Fine, sir, but Im sure I dont. And youre in no position to doubt my word.
</T>
<T>
EGEON
You dont know my voice? Oh, severe Time! Have you mangled my tongue so badly in these seven short years that my only son can no longer recognize my weak, sorrow-ravaged voice? Its true: this aged face of mine is hidden by a snow white beard, and the blood is freezing in my veins. But I still have a little memory left, and theres still some fire in my eyes; my dull, deaf ears can still hear a little. All these aging faculties tell meand I cannot be wrongthat you are my son, Antipholus.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
I never saw my father in my life.
</T>
<T>
EGEON
You know that we parted only seven years ago, in Syracuse. Maybe youre ashamed to admit that you know me because Im a prisoner now.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
The duke and everyone who knows me in this city can confirm thats not true. Ive never been to Syracuse in my life.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
I tell you, Syracusian. Ive been looking after Antipholus for twenty years, and during that time hes never been to Syracuse. Your old age and the prospect of death are making you imagine things.
</T>
<T>
ABBESS
Mighty duke, look here and see a man whos been treated most terribly!
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Either my eyes deceive me, or I see two husbands.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
(looks at the ANTIPHOLUS twins) One of these men is the others genius.(looks at the DROMIO twins) And the same with these two. But which is the man and which is the spiritgenius = attendant spirit, believed to follow a person throughout his lifespirit? Can anyone tell?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I, sir, am Dromio. Command this man to leave.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I, sir, am Dromio. Pray, let me stay.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
You are Egeon, arent you? Or are you his ghost?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Oh, my old master!Who tied him up?
</T>
<T>
ABBESS
Whoever tied him up, I will loosen the ropes, and with his freedom I will gain a husband. Tell us, old Egeon: are you the man who once had a wife named Emilia, who gave birth to two fair sons? Oh, if you are the same Egeon, speak now, and speak to that same Emilia!
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Why, now the story the merchant told me this morning is starting to make sense. These two Antipholuses, who look so alikeand these two Dromios, who seem to have the same faceand her story of being shipwreckedwhy, these two are the parents of these children and have been reunited by accident.
</T>
<T>
EGEON
If Im not dreaming, you are Emilia. If its really you, tell me what happened to our son, who floated away with you on that deadly raft.
</T>
<T>
ABBESS
Some men from Epidamnum rescued me, our son, and Dromio. But then a gang of violent fishermen from Corinth kidnapped Dromio and my son and carried them away. I dont know what became of them. You can see what became of me.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Antipholus, arent you originally from Corinth?
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
No, sir. I came from Syracuse.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Wait, dont stand next to each other. I cant tell whos who.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
I came from Corinth, Your Highness.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
And I came with him.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Your renowned uncle, Duke Menaphon, the famous soldier, brought me here.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Which of you two ate lunch with me today?
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I did, kind lady.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
And youre my husband, right?
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
No, hes not. I say no to that.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
So do I, although she called me her husband. And this beautiful gentlewoman, her sister, called me brother. (to LUCIANA) If all this is for real, I hope Ill get the chance to make good on all the things I said to you today.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Thats the necklace I gave you, sir.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I think it is, sir. I dont deny it.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
And you, sir, had me arrested over that necklace.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
I think I did, sir. I dont deny it.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
I sent Dromio to you with money for bail, but I dont think he brought it to you.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
No, he didnt get any by me.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I got this purse full of money from you, and my Dromio brought it to me. It seems that we kept running into each others servants all day. And everyone thought I was him, and he was me, and thats how all these errors came about.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
I want to use this money to set my father free.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Thats not necessary. Im going to let him live.
</T>
<T>
COURTESAN
Sir, I must get that diamond ring back from you.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
There, take it, and thanks for taking such good care of me.
</T>
<T>
ABBESS
Renowned duke, please join us in the abbey, where we will discuss at length all that has happened to us. Everyone assembled here who has been troubled by the days events join us as well, and we will straighten everything out. My sons, waiting to hear news of you has been like a second childbirth: this time, my labor lasted thirty-three years, and I am only now delivered of my heavy burden. Duke Solinus, my husband, and both my childrenand you two Dromios, who marked the day of my sons' births with your owncome into the abbey with me for a new christening. After such a long period of grief, we will have such a celebration!
</T>
<T>
DUKE
With all my heart, Ill join you.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
(to ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS) Master, should I go get your luggage off the ship?
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Dromio, what stuff of mine did you put on a ship?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
The stuff you had at the Centaur, sir.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
He means me. Im your master, Dromio. Come inside with us: well deal with that later. Embrace your brother there, and rejoice with him.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
You have a fat friend at your masters house: she took care of me in the kitchen today, thinking I was you. I guess now shes going to be my sister-in-law and not my wife.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I think youre my mirror, not my brother. And I can see by looking at you that Im a pretty good-looking fellow. Do you want to go in and join the party?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
After you, sir. Youre older than me.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Thats a good point. How can we tell which of us is the oldest?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Well draw straws. Meanwhile, after you.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
No, Ill tell you what. We came into the world as brother and brother, so now lets enter hand in handnot one before the other.
</T>
