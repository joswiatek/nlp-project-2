DUKE VINCENTIO
Escalus.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Yes, my lord?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Explaining government affairs always makes me talk excitedly. But since you know more about matters of government than I can ever tell you, the only thing left for me to say is this: rely on your natural ability, and let it work with your knowledge. You know as much, from both learning and experience, about the nature of our people, our citys laws and procedures, and our legal system as anyone I can think of. Here are your written orders; do not deviate from them. [To Attendants.] Go and order Angelo to come to me.
</T>
<T>
How do you think hell represent me?
For you must know, after careful consideration, Ive chosen him to rule in my absence, deputizing him with the dread and love my presence inspires, and transferring to him all the tools in my power. What do you think?
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
If anyone in Vienna deserves such an honor, its Lord Angelo.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Here he comes.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Here I am, obedient as always; what can I do for you?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Angelo, there is a distinctive pattern to your life that tells people what sort of man you are. But your talents dont belong to you alone, and you mustnt waste them by keeping them to yourself. Heaven uses us the way we use a torchnot to shine for itself, but to shed light onto the world. If we don't use our talents in the world, it would be the same as if we didn't have those talents at all. People are given certain natures to accomplish certain things. Mother Nature doesnt lend you even a smidgen of talent without expecting you to pay her backwith interest and gratitude. But here I am talking to someone who could instruct me! So, stand firm, Angeloin my absence, youll stand in for me completely. Viennas criminals will be executed or pardoned based on what you feel and say. Although old Escalus is senior to you, hell be your second-in-command. Take your written orders.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
My good lord, please test me further before you raise me to such a high, prominent position.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
No more procrastinating. Ive chosen you after careful consideration, so accept the honor. Its imperative that I leave now, even if it means leaving some important matters undiscussed. Ill write to you when I have the time and feel the need, telling you how I am, and Ill expect to hear how youre doing. So, goodbye; Ill leave you to carry out your orderssuccessfully, no doubt.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
My lord, will you allow us to escort you part of the way?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Sorry, Im in too big a rush. But please dont have any doubtsyou have all my authority to enforce or change the laws in any way that seems good to you. Lets shake hands, and Ill sneak off. I love the people but dont like to parade before them. I dont like their loud applause and emphatic cheering, though they can be politically useful; nor do I trust the judgment of any man who does desire such cheers and applause. Once again, goodbye.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
May heaven grant you a safe trip!
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
A happy departure, and a happy homecoming as well!
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Thank you. Goodbye.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Sir, Id like to have a frank talk with you because I want to figure out the exact nature of my new job. I know Ive got some authority, but how much, and what kind, Im not clear on.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Same with me. Lets leave together and we'll go figure it out.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Ill accompany you.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
If our Duke, along with the other Dukes, cant reach an agreement with the King of Hungary, theyre all going to attack him.
</T>
<T>
FIRST GENTLEMAN
May God give us peaceexcept not with Hungary.
</T>
<T>
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Amen.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
You talk like the self-righteous pirate who went to sea with the Ten Commandments but cut out one of the commandments.
</T>
<T>
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Was it Thou shalt not steal?
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Yep, thats the one.
</T>
<T>
FIRST GENTLEMAN
Right, because that commandment wouldve put the captain and his pirate crew out of businessthey went to sea to steal. When grace is being said before a meal, theres not a soldier among us who likes a prayer for peace.
</T>
<T>
SECOND GENTLEMAN
I never heard any soldier say he dislikes it.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
I believe youI dont think youve ever been at a table where they said grace.
</T>
<T>
SECOND GENTLEMAN
No? Ive heard it a dozen times at least.
</T>
<T>
FIRST GENTLEMAN
What, in verse?
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
In any form or in any language.
</T>
<T>
FIRST GENTLEMAN
Or in any religion.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Well, why not? Grace is grace, no matter what your religious beliefs are, just like youre a scoundrel, no matter how much grace you have.
</T>
<T>
FIRST GENTLEMAN
Hey, you and me are cut from the same cloth.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Rightthe way a piece of velvet and the scrap ends are from the same cloth. Youre the scrap.
</T>
<T>
FIRST GENTLEMAN
And youre the velvet: a nice, thick piece of piled velvet. I swear, Id rather be a piece of plain, English cloth than be like you, a French velvet thats full of pilesShakespeare plays on the word piles here. Piled velvet was plush, but piles refers also to the STD syphilis, commonly called the French disease. Syphilis leaves sores that at the time were often covered with velvet patches.piles and STDs. Got you there, didnt I?
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
I think you did, and from the painful way you talk, I think somethings got you down there. Id be glad to toast your health; just remind me never to drink from your glass after you.
</T>
<T>
FIRST GENTLEMAN
I guess I set myself up, didnt I?
</T>
<T>
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Yeah, you did, whether youve got something or not.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Oh, look, here comes Madam Satisfaction. The number of venereal diseases Ive caught under her roof comes to
</T>
<T>
SECOND GENTLEMAN
To what?
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Guess.
</T>
<T>
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Three thousand dollars worth.
</T>
<T>
FIRST GENTLEMAN
Yeah, and more.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
A syphilis sore more.
</T>
<T>
FIRST GENTLEMAN
Youre always suggesting Im diseased, but youre wrong. Im sound and healthy.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
You may be sound, but youre not healthy. Your bones sound hollow. Loose living has eaten out your insides.
</T>
<T>
FIRST GENTLEMAN
Hey, there! In which hip is the pain of your sciatica worse?
</T>
<T>
MISTRESS OVERDONE
Well, well. Theres someone over there whos been arrested and hauled off to prison who was worth five thousand of you all.
</T>
<T>
SECOND GENTLEMAN
Whos that?
</T>
<T>
MISTRESS OVERDONE
Thats Claudio, Signior Claudio.
</T>
<T>
FIRST GENTLEMAN
Claudio in prison? It cant be true.
</T>
<T>
MISTRESS OVERDONE
I know it's true: I saw him arrested and saw him carried away, and whats more, theyre chopping his head off in three days.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
All kidding aside, Id hate for this to be true. Are you sure?
</T>
<T>
MISTRESS OVERDONE
Im all too sure. Its for getting Miss
Julietta pregnant.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
She might be right about this. He promised to meet me two hours ago, and he always keeps his promises.
</T>
<T>
SECOND GENTLEMAN
You know, this is exactly the sort of thing we were just talking about.
</T>
<T>
FIRST GENTLEMAN
Most of all it fits with the public proclamation that was made.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Lets go see if we can get to the bottom of this.
</T>
<T>
MISTRESS OVERDONE
What with the war, plague, executions, and general poverty, Im losing business.
</T>
<T>
Hi! whats new with you?
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
That man over there is being hauled off to prison.
</T>
<T>
MISTRESS OVERDONE
What did he do?
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
A woman.
</T>
<T>
MISTRESS OVERDONE
But whats his crime?
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Fishing in the private part of a river.
</T>
<T>
MISTRESS OVERDONE
What, a virgin is pregnant because of him?
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
No, but a womans having a child because of him. You havent heard about the proclamation, have you?
</T>
<T>
MISTRESS OVERDONE
What proclamation, man?
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
All the brothels in the suburbs of Vienna must be torn down.
</T>
<T>
MISTRESS OVERDONE
And what about those in the city?
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Theyll be left standing. They wouldve been destroyed, too, but a savvy businessman bought them.
</T>
<T>
MISTRESS OVERDONE
But all our brothels in the suburbs are going to be demolished?
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Down to the ground, maam.
</T>
<T>
MISTRESS OVERDONE
Wow, that's a change for the country. Whats going to happen to me?
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Come on, dont worry. Good lawyers never lack for clients. Though you change locations, you dont need to change professions. Ill still be your pimp. Courage! Theyll take pity on you; all of you that have grown old and gray servicing people will be repaid.
</T>
<T>
MISTRESS OVERDONE
Whats all this fuss, Thomas Tapster? Lets get out of here.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Here comes Signior Claudio, led to prison by the provost. And there's Miss Juliet.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Man, why are you parading me like this in front of everyone? Take me off to prison already.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Im not being cruel. Its Lord Angelos special order.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
This is how the authorities, like gods, make us pay for our crimes. As the Bible says, God has mercy on those he chooses to have mercy on, and doesnt have mercy on those he chooses not to, and so on. I suppose thats fair.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Claudio! Why are you being arrested?
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
For being too promiscuous, Lucio, too promiscuous. The same way overeating leads to fasting, and overdoing anything leads to being restricted. Like rats gobbling up rat poison, we have a thirst for harmful things, and when we drink them we die.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
If I could speak so well while under arrest, Id ask a few creditors I know to come and lock me up. Though frankly, Id rather be foolish and free than wise and a prisoner. Whats your crime, Claudio?
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
To speak of it would be another crime.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
What, is it murder?
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
No.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Lechery?
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
You could call it that.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Sir, you have to go.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
(to the Provost) Just a minute, good friend. Lucio, let me have a word with you.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
A hundred, if theyll do you any good.
Is lechery regulated now?
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Heres what happened: I slept with Julietta after we got engaged. You know hershes practically my wife, except that we havent had an official ceremony. The only reason we didnt was to increase the amount of the dowry she might receive from her friends and relatives. We thought wed hide our love until we had a chance to win them over. But it turned out our secret intimacy had an all-too-obvious effect on Juliet.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Pregnant, huh?
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Unfortunately, yes. And this new deputy of the dukesI cant say whether hes been blinded by his new power or if he sees the public like a horse to be broken in, so he digs his spurs in right away to show it whos boss; or if hes just a bully; or if being a bully is part of the job. But this new governor is taking all these old penalties that, like rusty armor hanging on the wall, havent been used in years and is applying them to me. Hes imposing all these unenforced, long-ignored laws on me to make a name for himself. That has to be it, to make his name.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
I bet it is; and your head sits so precariously on your shoulders right now that the sigh of a lovesick milkmaid could knock it off. Get in touch with the duke and appeal to him.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
I tried, but he cant be found. Please, Lucio, do this favor for me: My sisters entering a nunnery and starting her training period today. Tell her the danger Im in, and implore her, in my name, to befriend this strict deputy and try to change his mind. Ive got a lot of hope in her. Her youthful sweetness alone would move a man. Besides, she has a gift for rhetoric, and she can really persuade people.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
I pray she can, for the lives of everyone like you who could now be punished, as well as for your own life, which Id be sad to see lost so stupidly for playing with you. Ill go to her.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Thank you, Lucio. Youre a good friend.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Ill be there in two hours.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
OK, officer, lets go.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
No, holy father, forget that idea. Dont think that Cupids feeble arrow can pierce this invulnerable bosom. I want you to shelter me secretly for a reason more ageless and serious than any youthful, burning desire.
</T>
<T>
FRIAR THOMAS
Can you talk about it?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Reverend sir, no one knows better than you how Ive always loved the quiet life and never cared much for the social scene where young people brag and throw their money around. Ive given Lord Angelo, a man of strict self-discipline and self-denial, my absolute power and position here in Vienna. He thinks Ive gone to Poland, since Ive spread that rumor among the general public, and everybody believes it. Now, religious sir, do you want to know why I did this?
</T>
<T>
FRIAR THOMAS
Yes, my lord.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
I instituted strict statutes and firm laws, necessary controls for headstrong human natures, but for nineteen years Ive let them grow lax, like an old, fat lion that lies in his cave and never leaves to hunt. Now, a doting father can make a birch whipping rod and wave it in his childrens faces, but if he only threatens and never uses it, eventually theyll laugh at it and not fear it. Similarly, our regulations have gone unenforced, and so theyre as good as dead. People are flouting the law with their loose living. The proper order of things is turned upside down, as if babies were spanking their nannies.
</T>
<T>
FRIAR THOMAS
It was in your lordships ability to get the justice system working again whenever you wanted. And it wouldve been taken more seriously if youd done it, rather than Lord Angelo.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Too seriously, Im afraid. Since it was my fault to give the people so much freedom, Id seem like a real tyrant now to whip them for things I allowed them to do. We essentially tell people to misbehave when we give evil deeds a pass and dont punish them. So, friar, Ive given the job to Angelo. He can effectively deal with this, in my namebut since Im not personally involved, I wont look bad. To see how he rules, Id like to visit him and the people disguised as one of your orders monks. So please furnish me with a robe and teach me how to behave like a real friar. When theres more time, Ill give you additional reasons for my actions. For now, Ill tell you this one: Lord Angelo is a puritanical man, constantly guarding himself against desire, the type who barely admits blood flows in his veins. So if power changes a persons principles, well see how he really is.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
And so you nuns have no other privileges?
</T>
<T>
FRANCISCA
Arent these enough?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Oh, yes. I didnt mean I wanted more freedom. Actually, I wish there were even more restrictions on the Saint Claire sisterhood.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
(offstage) Hello! Peace to this place!
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Whos that?
</T>
<T>
FRANCISCA
Its a mans voice. Isabella, unlock the door and ask him what he wants. I cant, but you can, since you havent taken your vows yet. Once you have, youll only be able to speak with men in the presence of the Mother Superior. Then, if you speak, you mustnt show your face. Or if you show your face, you mustnt speak. Hes calling again. Please answer him.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Peace and prosperity! Whos there?
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Well, hello, virginif you are one, as your rosy cheeks proclaim you to be. Can you help me to find Isabella, a novice here and the pretty sister to Claudio, her unlucky brother?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Why her unlucky brother? I ask, because Im Isabella, his sister.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Your brother sends you his love, sweet, pretty one. To get right to the point, hes in prison.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
How awful! For what?
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
For something which, if you ask me, he should be thanked rather than punished. Hes gotten his lover pregnant.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Sir, dont make things up.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Its true. I admit, I often play the deceiver and joker with young virgins and say things I dont mean. But because of your religious vocation, I see you as a heavenly, spiritual being, and someone to speak to with sincerely, as I would a saint.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
You mock real saints by calling me one.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Dont think that. In brief: your brother and his girl have slept together. And the same way your stomach gets full when you eatand as a bare field, when you plant it, yields a rich harvesther body shows the results of his plowing.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Hes made someone pregnant? My cousin Juliet?
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Is she your cousin?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Unofficially, in the silly but sweet way schoolgirls swear to be sisters.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Shes the one.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Oh, let him marry her.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Heres the problem. The duke has mysteriously left town. He deluded many menmyself includedwith the hope of some military action. But now we hear from government insiders that his publicly announced reasons for leaving were far from his real plans. In his place, and with his full authority, Lord Angelo rules. This is a man whose blood is like melted snow, never warmed by uncontrolled lust, but who represses and dulls his natural appetites with exercises for the mindstudying and fasting. To scare folks who are habitually promiscuous and have evaded the law like mice running past a lion, hes found a severe act that, if taken literally, would cost your brother his life. Hes arrested him under it and plans to make an example of him by strictly applying this law. All hope is gone, unless you can soften Angelo with your pretty prayers. Thats the essence of this errand between you and your poor brother.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Does he really intend to kill him?
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Hes already sentenced him to death, and I hear the provost has the warrant for his execution.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Oh, dear! What can a poor girl like me do to help?
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Test the power you have.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
My power? I doubt
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Our doubts work against us and make us lose the good things we often could win by making us scared to try. Go to Lord Angelo, and show him that when girls plead, men give like gods. But when girls cry and kneel, their requests are granted even more freely, as if the girls were asking themselves for permission.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Ill see what I can do.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Make it fast.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Ill go straightaway, as soon as I give notice of my business to the Mother Superior. Thank you so much. Give my brother my love. Ill let him know how I made out early this evening.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Ill go now.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Goodbye, sir.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
We mustnt let the law turn into a scarecrowsomething you set up to scare away birds of prey but then never change, until the birds get so used to it that they sit on it rather than fear it.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Yes, but we should also be precise. Better to use a scalpel than a hatchet, cutting carefully instead of chopping to death. This gentleman whose life Id like to save had such a noble father. I know youre a completely disciplined, virtuous man. But imagine you felt sexual stirrings for a woman, and you were in the right place at the right time, and by acting on that desire you could have her. If sometime in your life, youd made the same mistake for which you now condemn him, youd have brought the law down on yourself.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Its one thing to be tempted, Escalus, but another thing to give in. I dont deny that the twelve members of a jury might include a thief or two who are far guiltier than the prisoner theyre passing sentence on. But justice takes the opportunities it has; who knows what laws thieves pass against other thieves? Obviously, if we stumble across a jewel in the road, well bend down and take it, because we see it. But things we dont see, we step over and never think about. You cant excuse his crime on the grounds that I could have done the same thing. Instead, if Ithe man whos condemning himcommit the same offense, let this verdict of mine act as a precedent for my death, and let no allowances be made for me. Sir, he must die.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
As you command.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Where is the provost?
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Here, sir.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
See that Claudio is executed by nine tomorrow morning. Give him a priest to confess to, and let him prepare himself for death, for this is his journeys end.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
(to himself) Well, heaven forgive himand forgive us all!
Some people succeed by sinning, and some are brought down by virtue. Some people run from dubious situations and so never suffer punishment, and some people get punished for a single mistake.
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
Bring them this way. If these arent the kind of people who do nothing but dirty things in whorehouses, then I dont know the law. Bring them this way.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Well, sir! Whats your name? And whats the matter?
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
If it pleases your honor, I am the dukes poor
police officer, and my name is Elbow. I rely on the law, sir, and bring in here before you two notorious benefactors (confusing the word benefactor with malefactor).
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Benefactors? What benefactors are they? Arent they malefactors?
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
If it pleases your honor, I dont really know what they
are. But theyre definitely scoundrels, that Im sure
of, and lacking the universal piety that all good Christians ought to have.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
(to Angelo, sarcastically) Hes a good talker, and a real smart cop.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Out with it. Whats their rank? Your names Elbow? Why dont you speak, Elbow?
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
He cant, sir. Hes been pushed out of the way.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
(to Pompey) What do you do, sir?
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
Him, sir! Hes a bartender, sir, and a part-time pimp, one who works for a madam. Her brothel in the suburbs, sir, was, as they say, torn down, and now she claims to run a bathhouse, and I think thats a bad house too.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
How do you know that?
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
My wife sir, whom I detest with heaven and your honor as my witnesses
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
What, you detest your wife?
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
Yes, sir, whom, I thank heaven, is a morally upright woman
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Thats why you detest her?
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
I say, sir, Ill detest myself as well as her, if this
house, if its not a whorehouse, its a great pity, for its an immoral place.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
How do you know that?
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
From my wife, who, if she had been a woman given to sin, might have been accused of fornication, adultery, and all sorts of dirty things there.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Because of the actions of the madam of the whorehouse?
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
Yes, sir, by Mistress Overdones doing. But my wife spit in this mans face, defying him.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Please, sir, this is not true.
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
Prove it before these rogues here, you honorable man. Prove it.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
(to Angelo) Do you hear how he mixes up his words?
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Sir, this very pregnant woman came in, longingI beg your honors pardonfor stewed prunesa dish commonly served as a cure for syphilis in brothels, which were also called stewsstewed prunes. Sir, we had only two in the house, which at that very time were sitting, it so happened, in a fruit dish, a three-cent dish. Your honors have seen such dishes; theyre not fine china, but theyre very good dishes
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Get on with it. Never mind about the dish, sir.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
No, sir, youre right. Its not worth a pin, but back to the point. As I was saying, this Mrs. Elbow, was, as I say, very pregnant, and longing, as I said, for prunes. We had only two left in the dish, as I said, and this very man, Mr. Froth here, having eaten the rest and paid for them very generously. Because as you know, Mr. Froth, I couldnt give you three cents change.
</T>
<T>
FROTH
No, indeed.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Very well. If you remember, you were talking about the previously mentioned prunes
</T>
<T>
FROTH
Right, I was.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Ok, and I was telling you, if you remember, that so-and-so couldnt be cured of you-know-whatsyphilisyou-know-what, unless they kept to a strict diet
</T>
<T>
FROTH
All this is true.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Why, very well, then
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Youre a tedious fool. Get to the point. What was done to Elbows wife that gave him a reason to complain? Come and get to what was done to her.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Sir, your honor cant get to that yet.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Thats not what I meant, sir.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
But you will get it, sir, if your honor pleases. And, I beg you, look at Mr. Froth here, sir; a man who makes only 80 pounds a year and whose his father died, leaving him an inheritance, on All Saints Daywasnt it All Saints Day, Mr. Froth?
</T>
<T>
FROTH
Halloween.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Very well. I hope well get to the truth here. He, sir,
was sitting, as I say, in a reclining chair, sir. It was at the Bunch of Grapes tavern, where you like to sit and relax, dont you?
</T>
<T>
FROTH
I do, because the room has a big open fire, good in winter.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Why, very well, then. I hope well get to the truth here.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
This could last as long as a night in Russia, during the time of year when nights are longest. Im leaving. Ill leave you to get to the bottom of this case, hoping youll find reasons to whip them all.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
I think I will. Good-bye, your lordship.
</T>
<T>
Now, sir, come on: what happened to Elbows wife, once more?
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Once, sir? Nothing happened to her once.
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
I beg you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
I beg your honor, ask me.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Well, sir; what did this gentleman do to her?
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
I beg you, sir, look at this gentlemans face. Good Mr. Froth, look at his honorits for a good reason. Does your honor see his face?
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Yes, sir, very well.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
No, I beg you, really study it.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Well, I am.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Does your honor see any harm in his face?
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Why, no.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Ill swear upon a bible, his face is the worst
thing about him (confusing supposed for deposed). And if his face is the worst thing about him, how could Mr. Froth do the officers wife any harm? Id like your honor to explain that.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Hes right. Officer, what do you say to that?
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
(confusing respected for suspected throughout) First, if it pleases you, the house is a respected house; next, this is a respected fellow, and his employer a respected woman.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
I swear, sir, his wife is a more respected person than any of us.
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
Scoundrel, you lie. You lie, wicked scoundrel! The
time has yet to come that she was ever respected
by man, woman, or child.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Sir, he respected her before he married her.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Whos smarter here? The representative of justice or the representative of sinJustice and Iniquity were names of common characters in morality playsrepresentative of justice or the representative of sin? Is this true?
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
Oh, you wretch! Oh, you scoundrel! Oh, you cannibal! I respected her before I was married to her! If I ever respected her, or she respected me, Im not the dukes poor officer. Prove this, you wicked cannibal, or Ill sue you for assault.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
If he boxed your ears, you could sue him for slander, too.
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
Thank you, your worship. What would you like me to do with this wicked wretch?
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Honestly, officer, because hes committed some crime that you would expose if you were capable, let him keep on until you figure out what it is.
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
Thank you, your worship. Now, you wicked wretch, you see whats going to happen to you: youre to be kept on; theyre keeping you on.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Where were you born, friend?
</T>
<T>
FROTH
Here in Vienna, sir.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Do you have an income of 80 pounds a year?
</T>
<T>
FROTH
Yes, sir.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
All right. What do you do, sir?
</T>
<T>
POMPHEY
Bartender; a poor widows bartender.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Your employers name?
</T>
<T>
POMPHEY
Mistress Overdone.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Has she had more than one husband?
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Nine, sir. She got the name Overdone from the last one.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Nine! Come here, Mr. Froth. Mr. Froth, Id prefer you not associate with bartenders. Theyll draw you dry, Mr. Froth, and youll get them hangeda play on hanging and drawing, a form of execution involving hanging and then disembowelingTheyll draw you dry, Mr. Froth, and youll get them hanged. Get out, and dont let me hear of you again.
</T>
<T>
FROTH
Thank you, your worship. Personally, I never go into bars, unless Im drawn ina play on ale being drawn from a tapdrawn in.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Well, not anymore, Mr. Froth. Goodbye.
</T>
<T>
Come here, Mr. Bartender. Whats your name, Mr. Bartender?
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Pompey.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
What else?
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Ass, sir.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Yes, and your ass is the biggest thing about you, so in the crudest sense you are Pompey the Great. Pompey, youre a part-time pimp, however much you hide it by bartending, arent you? Come on, itll be better for you if you tell me the truth.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Honestly, sir, Im a poor man just trying to earn a living.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
How would you live, Pompey? By being a pimp? What
do you think of that profession, Pompey? Is it a legal profession?
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
If the law allowed it, sir.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
But the law will not allow it, Pompey, nor will it be allowed in Vienna.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Does your worship mean to castrate and spay all the young men and women in town?
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
No, Pompey.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Then, sir, in my poor opinion, theyll get it on. If your worship would make arrangements for the whores and their clients, you wouldnt need to fear the pimps.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
I can tell you, were introducing some strong penalties specifically, beheading and hanging.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
If you behead and hang everyone who breaks the law by having sex, in just ten years youll have to commission people to repopulate the city. If this law lasts a decade in Vienna, Ill rent the best house in town at three cents a square foot. If youre alive to see this, say Pompey told you so.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Thank you, Pompey, and, in return for your prediction, listen carefully. I advise you, dont let me find you appearing before me again upon any complaint whatsoever, not even for living where you do. If I do, Ill beat you like Julius Caesar did to your namesakePompeyIn Shakespeares Julius Caesar, Caesar defeats a rival named PompeyPompeyand send you scurrying to your tent in defeat. To put it plainly, Pompey, I will have you whipped. So, for now, Pompey, goodbye.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
I thank your worship for your good advice.
</T>
<T>
But I shall follow it only as my body and my opportunities dictate. Whip me? No, no; let a cart driver whip his old nag. A brave heart isnt whipped out of his job.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Come here, Mr. Elbow; come here, Mr. Policeman.
How long have you been a policeman?
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
Seven and a half years, sir.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
I thought youd been at the job for a while, given your skill at it. You say seven years altogether?
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
And a half, sir.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Oh, thats so hard on you. Its wrong that you have to work so much. Arent there enough capable men in your precinct?
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
Honestly, sir, few who are bright enough. Theyre happy to have me substitute for them. They pay me a little money, and I handle all the duties.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Please bring me some six or seven names, the most competent people in your parish.
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
To your worships house, sir?
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
To my house. Goodbye.
</T>
<T>
What time is it?
</T>
<T>
JUSTICE
Eleven, sir.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Please, come home to lunch with me.
</T>
<T>
JUSTICE
Im most grateful. Thank you.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Claudios death saddens me, but theres no way to prevent it.
</T>
<T>
JUSTICE
Lord Angelo is severe.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Its unfortunately necessary. Mercy isnt often what it seems, since pardoning a crime can lead to additional pain. Even sopoor Claudio! Theres no way to prevent it. Lets go, sir.
</T>
<T>
SERVANT
Hes listening to a case. Hell come at once, when I tell him youre here.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Please do.
</T>
<T>
Ill ask him his intentions; maybe hell relent. Claudio didnt consciously commit a crime. People of every class and age indulge in this viceand hes going to die for it!
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Now, whats the matter, Provost?
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Do you want Claudio to die tomorrow?
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Did I not tell you yes? Dont you have your orders? Why do you ask again?
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
In case I might be too rash. Correct me if Im wrong, but Ive seen judges regret imposing the death sentence after the execution.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Enoughthats my problem. Do your job, or resign your position. We can easily do without you.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
I beg your honors pardon. What should we do, sir, with Juliet? Shes in labor, very close to giving birth.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Make arrangements to get her to a more appropriate place, and do it quickly.
</T>
<T>
SERVANT
The condemned mans sister is here and wants to speak to you.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
He has a sister?
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Yes, my good lorda very virtuous girl whos entering a convent, if she hasnt already.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Well, bring her in.
</T>
<T>
See that the tramp Juliet is moved, and provide her with everything she needs, but nothing extravagant. Ill authorize it.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
(departing) God save your honor!
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Dont leave yet.
</T>
<T>
Welcome. What do you want?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
I sadly beg a request of your honor. Please hear me, your honor.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Well, whats your request?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Theres a certain vice that I hate, and would love to see struck down by law. Id rather not plead for it, but I must. I shouldnt plead for it, but Im torn between wanting and not wanting to.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Well, whats the matter?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
I have a brother whos condemned to death. I beg you, condemn his crime but not him.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
(to himself) Heaven give you the power to persuade him!
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Condemn the crime and not the person who commits it? Why, by definition every crime is condemned before its committed. I would have a meaningless role if I just punished the crimes whose penalties were in the law books and let the criminal go.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Oh, fair but harsh law! Then I had a brother but dont anymore. (departing) Heaven protect your honor!
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
(aside to ISABELLA) Dont give up so fast. Go to him again, beg him, kneel down before him, cling to his gown.
Youre too cold. You couldnt be more casual if you were asking him for a pin. Go to him.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Does he have to die?
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Miss, theres no way out.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Yes, there is. I think that you could pardon him, and no one on heaven or earth would be sorry.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
I wont do it.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
But could you, if you wanted to?
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Look, what I wont do, I cant do.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
But might you do it, without harming the world, if your heart felt as compassionate toward him as mine does?
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Hes sentenced; its too late.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
(aside to ISABELLA) Youre too cold.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Too late? why, noI can speak a word and then take it back. Believe this: no symbol of authoritynot the kings crown, or the deputys sword, or the military officers baton, or the judges robemakes a person great as much as mercy does. If hed been you and youd been him, you would have slipped like he did; but he, in your place, wouldnt have been so stern.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Please leave.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
I wish to heaven I had your power, and you were Isabel! Would things be like this? No, Id decide what it is to be a judge, and to be a prisoner.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
(aside to ISABELLA) Yes, thats the way to talk.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Your brother is doomed for breaking the law. Youre wasting your breath.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
How sad! Why, all the souls on earth were doomed once upon a timebecause Adam and Eve disobeyed God and ate from the tree of knowledgedoomed once upon a time. And God, who might have seized the chance to condemn us, instead found a way to redeem our sinsa reference to God letting Christ die to redeem mankinds sinsfound a way to redeem our sins. What would happen to you, if he who is the highest judge of all should judge you as you are now? Oh, think about that, and then merciful speech will flow out your mouth, as if you had been reborn.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Accept it, lovely lady. Its the law, not I, that condemns your brother. Were he my cousin, brother, or my son, itd be the same. He must die tomorrow.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Tomorrow! Oh, thats so sudden! Spare him, spare him!
Hes not prepared for death. We only kill fowl in season, when theyre in the best shape for eating. Should we serve him up to heaven with less respect than we show toward our inferior mortal bodies? My good, good lord, consider: who else has died for this crime? Many people have committed it.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
(aside to ISABELLA) Yes, well said.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
The law wasnt dead, but it was asleep. All those people wouldnt have dared to commit that crime if the first lawbreaker had been punished. Now the laws awake, notes whats going on, and, like a fortuneteller, looks in a crystal ball to see what future evils, either newly conceived or just being contemplated, will someday hatch. Now, they wont develop any further but will die before theyre born.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Show some pity.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
I show it most of all when I show justice, for then I pity all those people I dont know whod be harmed by an unpunished crime. I do right to the man who, by paying for one wrong act, doesnt live to commit another one. Be satisfied with this. Your brother dies tomorrow. Accept it.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
So you must be the first one to impose this sentence,
and he the first one to suffer it. Oh, its excellent
to have a giants strength, but its tyranny to use it like a giant.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
(aside to ISABELLA) Thats well said.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
If men of power could thunder and wield lightning as the god Joveking of the gods in Roman mythologyJove himself does, Jove would never have any peace, for every puny, petty official would use his heaven for thunder, nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven, you use your sharp, sulfur-scented lightning bolts to split the hard gnarled oak tree, rather than the soft myrtle bush. But give a proud man a little bit of temporary authority and he forgets what it means to be made in Gods image. Instead, like an angry ape that mimics peoples behavior, he does such incredibly grotesque things before high heaven that the angels, if they were human, would either weep or die laughing.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
(aside to ISABELLA) Oh, keep at him, keep at him, girl! Hes going to relent. Hes coming around, I can tell.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
(to himself) Pray heaven she wins him over!
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
We cant use ourselves as a standard to judge others. Great men may joke about the saints; thats good fun. But if an ordinary person does it, its profane.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Youre right, girl. Keep talking like that.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
When a captain curses, its just angry words. When a private does it, its blasphemy.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
(aside to ISABELLA) You know about that sort of stuff? Tell us more.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Why are you attacking me with these sayings?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Because people in authority, even though they sin like everyone else, apply a sort of bandage to coverbut not curetheir sinful sores. Look in your heart and ask yourself if youve ever experienced anything like my brothers crime. If your heart admits to being guilty of the same natural impulses, dont say a word to condemn my brother.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
(to himself) She speaks with such sense, shes got my senses and desire stirred up. Goodbye.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
My gracious lord, come back.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Ill consider the matter. Come again tomorrow.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Ill bribe youcome back, my good lord.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
What? Bribe me?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Yes, with gifts from heaven.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
(aside to ISABELLA) You nearly blew it.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Not with silly coins of real gold, or jewels whose value rises and falls, depending on fashion; but with constant prayers that will rise up and enter heaven before dawnthe prayers of protected souls, nuns whose minds are dedicated only to spiritual things.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Well, come see me tomorrow.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
(aside to ISABELLA) Great, thats enough. Lets go!
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Heaven keep your honor safe!
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
(to himself) Amenfor Im falling into temptation, where desires and prayers work against each other.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
What time tomorrow should I come to your lordship?
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Anytime before noon.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
God save your honor!
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
From you, and from your virtue, too! Whats happening? Is this her fault or mine? The tempter or the tempted, who sins the most? Ha! Its not her, shes not trying to be a tempter. Its me. Its like Im lying in a field of violets, only instead of blossoming and smelling like a flower, Im rotting and stinking like a corpse from the same sun that makes the flowers grow. Is it possible that a modest woman can arouse desire more than a seductive one? Having destroyed enough land already, should a person want to tear down a holy place and establish evil there as well? Oh, damn, damn, damn! Angelo, what are you doing, who are you? Do you sinfully desire her for the things that make her good? Oh, I should let her brother live! Thieves are justified in robbing when the judges themselves are thieves. Can it be Im in love with her, when I want to hear her speak again, and gaze into her eyes? What am I dreaming of? Oh, the devils a cunning enemyto catch a saint, he baits the hook with saints! The most dangerous temptation is the one that uses our love of goodness to draw us into sin. A prostitute could never attract me, even with her two powers: her seductive skills and her natural endowments. But this virtuous girl totally overwhelms me. Whenever I saw men who were infatuated like idiots, I smiled and didnt understandup until now.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Hello, ProvostI think thats who you are.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
I am the provost. What do you want, good friar?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
My sense of charity and my religious order make it my duty to come visit the troubled souls here in prison. Grant me the clergys usual right to see them, and tell me the nature of their crimes, so I may minister to them accordingly.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Id do more than that, if it were needed.
</T>
<T>
Look, here comes one: a gentlewoman in my charge who, by giving in to her youthful passion, has ruined her reputation. Shes pregnant, and the childs father is sentenced to death. Hes just a young man, who deserves the chance to make more babies, rather than to die for this one.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
When must he die?
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Tomorrow, I think.
</T>
<T>
Ive gotten accommodations for you. Wait here, and youll be escorted to them.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Pretty one, do you repent the sin youre carrying?
</T>
<T>
JULIET
I do, and patiently bear the shame.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Ill teach you how to examine your conscience, and to test if your repentance is real or insincere.
</T>
<T>
JULIET
Ill gladly learn.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Do you love the man who wronged you?
</T>
<T>
JULIET
Yes, as I love myself, the woman who wronged him.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
So then it seems your sinful act was mutually committed?
</T>
<T>
JULIET
Mutually.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
But your sin is heaviera play on words. Heavier means more serious but also refers literally to the heavy child Juliet carriesheavier than his.
</T>
<T>
JULIET
I do confess it, and repent it, father.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Thats appropriate, daughter. But if youre only sorry because your sins been found out, thats being sorry for yourself, not for offending Heaven. We tend to repent out of fear of God, rather than love for him
</T>
<T>
JULIET
I repent because my act was evil. Im happy to be ashamed of it.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Maintain that attitude. I hear your partner must die tomorrow, and Im going to give him spiritual guidance.
Grace go with you, and God bless you!
</T>
<T>
JULIET
Must die tomorrow! Oh, painful love! By making me pregnant, its spared my lifethe law spared a pregnant female prisoner from executionits spared my life. But that comfort means I have to live with the horror of Claudios death.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Hes to be pitied.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
When I try to pray and think, I think and pray about different things. My empty wordsempty here can mean two things: the first meaning is absent-minded or without conviction, since Angelo speaks to heaven but his thoughts are on Isabel; it also suggests meaningless, since his impure thoughts about Isabel prove he doesnt mean the pious words he speaks.empty words focus on heaven, while my imagination ignores what Im saying and fixates on Isabel. Its as if Im only mouthing Gods name, while an evil idea grows in my heart. The politics I used to study with such interest now seem dry and tedious. The dignity I was so proud of (I hope no one hears this) is now worth even less than some silly hat feather waving uselessly in the wind. Oh, how often do rank and ceremonial trappings impress the foolish and entrap even the wise! Passions are passionsthey cannot simply be swept away. You can write good angel on the devils horns, but that doesnt change his devilish nature.
</T>
<T>
Hello! Whos there?
</T>
<T>
SERVANT
One Isabel, a nun, wishes to see you.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Show her the way.
</T>
<T>
Oh, heavens! Why does my blood rush to my heart, both choking it and making the rest of my body weak? Its like a stupid crowd surrounding somebody who faintstheyre all trying to help him and actually theyre cutting off the air he needs. Or, like the common people who drop what theyre doing and rush over to see their beloved king when he appears, fawning and crowding him so much that their ignorant adoration becomes offensive.
</T>
<T>
How are you, pretty lady?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Ive come to find out what you want to do.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
If only you knew what I want to do and didnt have to ask. Your brother cannot live.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Very well, then. Heaven keep your honor!
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
On the other hand, he may live awhilemaybe as long as you or me. Still, he must die.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
By your command?
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Yes.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
I beg you, tell me when. So that, no matter how long or short his reprieve is, hell be spiritually prepared and can save his soul.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Ha! Damn these filthy vices! One might as well pardon a murderer as forgive a fornicator who begets an illegitimate child. Its as easy to take a legitimate life as it is to create an illegitimate one.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Heaven may regard the two sins as equal, but humans do not.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
You think so? Then Ill put this question to you: which would you prefer, that this very fair law took your brothers life, or to save your brother, you give up your body to the same sort of sweet sin as did the girl he ruined?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Sir, believe this, Id rather give up my body than my soul.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Im not talking about your soul: sins were compelled to commit get counted, but they dont count against us.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
What are you saying?
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
No, dont hold me to that, for I can argue a point I dont really believe. Answer this. As the voice of the written law, I pronounce a death sentence on your brothers life. Might it not be charity to commit a sin to save this brothers life?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
If you want to do it, Ill risk the punishment on my soul, and say itd be no sin at all, but charity.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
If you felt like doing it, even at the risk of your soul, sin and charity would balance each other perfectly.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
If begging for his life is a sin, Heaven let me bear it! If your granting my request is a sin, Ill pray each morning to have it added to my faults and not one you have to answer for.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
No, listen to me. Youre not following me. Either youre dumb or youre playing dumb, and thats not good.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Call me dumb, then, and not very good. Let me accept by Gods grace that Im not any better than that.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
This is how smart people try to seem really bright: by knocking their own intelligence. Its the same way hiding behind a black mask makes a woman seem ten times more beautiful than her naked face does. But pay attention. Ill be more blunt, so that you get it. Your brother is to die.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Yes.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Thats the penalty for his crime, under the law.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
True.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Suppose that there was no other way to save his lifenot that Im admitting this, its just for the sake of argumentlets say that you, his sister, were desired by someone whose influence with the judge, or whose own powerful position, could rescue your brother from the laws binding chains. And there was no other earthly way to save him, unless you gave your virginity to this hypothetical man, or else your brother dies. What would you do?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
I would do this as much for my poor brother as myselfthat is, if I were under a death sentence, Id strip myself naked and display the whips bloody lashes like rubies. And Id go to my death like going to my bed, before Id surrender my body to sin.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Then your brother must die.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
And thats the better bargain. Better a brother die once than a sister suffer eternal damnation to save him.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Then arent you as cruel as the sentence youve so deplored?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
A shameful release and an unconditional pardon are two different things. Legal mercy is in no way related to an immoral rescue.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
You said a little while ago the law was tyrannical, arguing that your brothers sinning was a lighthearted act, not
a vice.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Oh, forgive me, my lord. To get what we want, we often say things we dont mean. Ive made excuses for something I hate in order to help the brother I love.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Were all weak.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Yes. Otherwise, my brother would deserve to die, if he were the only person to have inherited this weakness.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
No, women are weak too.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Yes, as weak their mirrors, which break as easily as they reflect images. WomenHeaven help us!are ruined by men who take advantage of us. Call us frail ten times over, for were as soft as our skin, and gullible.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
I agree. And based on what you say about your sexsince I suppose were only as strong as our own weakest pointslet me be bold. I take you at your word. Be what you area woman, that is. If you are better than that, then youre not a woman. But if you are one, as you certainly seem to be by all outward appearances, show it now by being weak.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
I can only speak with a sincere tongue. My gentle lord,
please talk plainly, as you did before.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
To put it plainly, I love you.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
My brother loved Juliet, and you tell me that hell die for it.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
He wont, Isabel, if you give me love.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
I know your virtue gives you the freedom to act wicked, in order to test others.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Believe me, I swear I mean what I say.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
What! To believe so much in someone with so little honor and such evil intentions! You deceiver! Ill denounce you, Angelo, believe me. Sign a pardon for my brother immediately, or Ill scream to the entire world what sort of man you are.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Who will believe you, Isabel? My spotless reputation, my strict way of living, my testimony against you, and my position will all outweigh your accusation. Youll be silenced and discredited, accused of slander. The starting gate is open now, and my desires are off and running. Feed my hungerno more of your modesty and time-wasting blushes, which charm me and then banish me for being charmed. Save your brother by sleeping with me, or hell be put to death. And not only that, but itll be death by torture, drawn out by your cruelty. Accept my offer tomorrow, or by my almighty passion, Ill tyrannize him. As for you, say what you want. My lie, which calls your claim false, will outweigh your true claim.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Who can I complain to? If I reported this, who would believe me? Oh, dangerous mouths, with double-talking tongues that can both condemn and approve, and make the law bow to their wishes. They put their sexual desires before notions of right and wrong! Ill go to my brother. Although he gave in to his bodys demands, his minds so honorable that, if he had twenty heads to lay on twenty bloody execution blocks, hed give them all up, rather than let his sister pollute her body. So, Isabel, youll live chaste, and brother, youll die. My chastity is more important than my brother. Ill tell him of Angelos request, and prepare him for deathand the eternal rest of his soul.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
So, you hope for a pardon from Lord Angelo?
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Hope is the only medicine miserable people have. I hope to live, and am prepared to die.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Be ready to die; then either death or life will be all the sweeter. Tell life this: if I lose you, I lose something that only fools would want to keep. Youre just a breath, subject to all the changes of weather that hourly buffet the body you occupy. Youre simply deaths dupe, constantly struggling to run away from him, while all the while youre running toward him. Youre not noble, because all your civilized comforts come from lowly plants and animals. Youre by no means brave, because the forked tongue of a little snake scares you. Sleep is your best way to rest, and you do that a lot, yet you stupidly fear death, which is basically the same thing. Youre not a single being, because youre composed of thousands of grains of dust. Youre not happy, because youre always trying to get what you dont have, and what you do have, you forget about. Youre unstable, your moods changing as often as the phases of the moon. If youre rich, youre actually poorlike an ass staggering under a load of gold bars, youre just carrying your heavy wealth for a period, and you lose that wealth when you die. You dont have any friends, for even your childrenthe offspring of your own loinscurse the gout, skin rashes, and colds for not carrying you off sooner. Youre neither old or young, but always suspended in a sort of mid-afternoon nap, because when young, youre like an old beggar, wheedling money from your feeble elders. And when youre old and rich yourself, you have neither the passion, love, agility, or beauty to enjoy your wealth. So, what in all this is worth living for? Life hides more than a thousand deaths. Yet its death, which fixes all these problems, that we fear.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
I humbly thank you. In looking to live, I find I actually seek to die, and by seeking death, I find life. Let death come.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
(offstage) Hello, there! Peace, grace, and good company to everyone here!
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Whos there? Come in. That wish deserves a welcome.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Dear sir, Ill visit you again soon.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Most holy sir, thank you.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
My business is a word or two with Claudio.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
And very welcome. Look, signor, heres your sister.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Provost, a word with you.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
As many as you please.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Take me to a place where I can hide and overhear them.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Now, sister, whats the good word?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Why, as all good words arevery good indeed. Lord Angelo has business with heaven, and hes going to make you his ambassador therean eternal appointment. So get ready, quickly. Tomorrow you set off.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Is there no way out?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
None, except a way that would save his head by breaking my heart in two.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
But is there any?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Yes, brother, you can live. If you beg him, the judge will offer a devilish sort of mercy that will free you, yet chain you until death.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Lifetime imprisonment?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Yes, exactly. A type of lifetime imprisonment that would limit your movements, even if you had the freedom to roam the entire world.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
But what type?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
The type that, if you agreed to it, would strip your honor from your body like bark from a tree trunk, and leave you exposed to shame.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Get to the point.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Oh, Im afraid of you, Claudio. I tremble to think you would cherish a wild existence and would value six or seven years of life more than everlasting honor. Do you dare to die? The worst part of death is anticipating it. A beetle we step on suffers as much as a giant when it dies.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Why are you shaming me like this? Do you think I can summon my resolve from flowery, comforting speeches?
If I have to die, I will meet the darkness like a bride,
and hug it in my arms.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Now, thats my brother talkinglike my father speaking from his grave. Yes, you must die. Youre too noble to save yourself in a shameful way. This seemingly saintly deputy, whose composed face and carefully calculated words target and attack young people like some bird of prey, is really a devil. If you drained him of all the filth inside him, youd reveal a pond as deep as hell.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
The priestly Angelo!
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Oh, its a cunning disguise from hell, to cloak and cover the wickedest people in priestly clothes. Can you believe it, Claudio? If I gave him my virginity, youd be freed.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Oh, heavens! It cant be.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Yes, in exchange for this awful sin, hed free you to keep on sinning. Tonights the time I have to do something I hate to even pronounce, or else you die tomorrow.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
You mustnt do it.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Oh, if it were just my life, Id throw it away like a pin to save you.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Thanks, dear Isabel.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Yes. Is his lust so great that it causes him to make a mockery of the law, even while hes enforcing it? Of course, it isnt a sin, or anyway its the least of the seven deadly sins.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Which is the least?
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
If it were a damnable thing, whyif hes so wisewould he risk being eternally punished for a momentary pleasure? Oh, Isabel!
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
What are you saying?
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Death is a fearful thing.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
And a disgraced life a hateful one.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Yes, but to die, and go who knows where. To lie cold and congealing, and to rotthis conscious, warm body to become a compact lump of earth, and the vast spirit to swim in hells fiery floods or reside in a frigid land of thick ice. To be confined inside invisible winds and perpetually, violently blown all around the world hanging in space. Or to be worse off than one of those tortured souls howling from punishment of sinful thoughtsits too horrible! The weariest, most hateful life that old age, aches, poverty and imprisonment can inflict on us is paradise compared to our fears of death.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Oh, no!
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Sweet sister, let me live. Any sin you commit to save a brothers life, nature will pardon as though it were a good deed.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Oh, you beast! Treacherous coward! Shameful wretch!
Will you be given your life as a result of my vice? Isnt it a kind of incest, to gain life from your own sisters shame? What should I think? God forbid, my mother must have cheated on my father, for such a twisted son as you never could have sprung from his blood! I renounce youdie, perish! Even if all I had to do was pray on bended knees to stop your execution, Id let it happen. Ill pray a thousand prayers for your death, and not one word to save you.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
No, listen to me, Isabel.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Oh, shame, shame, shame! Your sin was no one-time accident, but a habit. Granting you mercy would be like pimping, enabling you to do it again. Its best that you die right away.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Oh, listen to me, Isabella!
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Permit me to say a word, young sister, just one word.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
What do you want?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
If you can spare the time, Id like to talk with you in a little while. Youd be doing yourself a favor as well as me.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
I dont have any spare time, but Ill wait for you a little while.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Son, I overheard what happened between you
and your sister. Angelo never meant to seduce her. He was only testing her virtue, to test his ability to judge character. Being a person of integrity, she virtuously refused him, and he was happy to hear it. Im Angelos confessor, so I know this is true. Therefore, prepare yourself for death. Dont prop yourself up with false hopes. Tomorrow you must die. Fall to your knees and prepare for confession.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Let me ask my sister to forgive me. Im so out of love
with life that Ill pray to be rid of it.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Maintain that attitude. Farewell.
</T>
<T>
Provost, a word with you!
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
What is it, father?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Now that youve come over, you should go away. Leave me with the girl awhile. My intentions and the fact that Im a friar guarantee that nothing bad will happen to her.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Very well.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
He who made you lovely made you good, as well. Beauty has a cheap kind of goodness, which is why beauty doesnt last. But virtue lies at the heart of your character, so you will always be beautiful. Ive heard about Angelos sexual advances to you, and if there werent other examples of such lapses, Id be really surprised. What are you going to do to satisfy this stand-in and save your brother?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Im going now to give him my answer: Id rather my brother die by legitimate execution than have an illegitimate baby. But, oh, how wrong the good duke was about Angelo! If he ever returns and I can speak to him, the first words I speak will be to expose Angelos way of governing.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Thats not a bad idea. But, as the matter now stands, hell deny your accusation. Hell say he was only testing you. So, listen to my advice. My delight in doing good gives me an idea for a solution. Im convinced theres a way you righteously can do a poor wronged lady some well-deserved good, save your brother from the cruel law, keep your own gracious self pure, and greatly please the absent duke, if he ever returns to hear about all this.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Tell me more. I have the courage to do anything, as long as it doesnt strike me as wrong.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Virtue is bold, and goodness is never afraid. Have you ever heard of Mariana, the sister of Frederick, the great soldier who died at sea?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Ive heard of the lady, and people always spoke well of her.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
She was supposed to marry this Angelo. They were engaged, and the wedding day was set. But before the ceremony, her brother Frederick was lost at sea, in the ship that was carrying his sisters dowry. The poor woman suffered a heavy blow. She lost a famous, noble brother, who loved her dearly and devotedly. She lost with him her dowry, the bulk of her fortune, and with both, she lost her
husband-to-be, this oh-so-respectable Angelo.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Can this be true? Did Angelo leave her?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Left her in her tears, without drying a single one of them. He reneged on his vows completely, saying he discovered that shed been unfaithful to him. He gave her only grief, basically, and she still wears it, like a wedding dress. Her tears wash over him, but like a marble statue, he never budges.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Its the equivalent of a death to take this poor girl away from the world! And life is so unfair, that this man lives! But how can she benefit from all this?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Its a break that you can easily heal, and the cure not only saves your brother, but keeps you from dishonor.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Show me how, good father.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
This maid still loves Angelo. Logically, his unfair cruelty should have ended her love, but its actually intensified it, the way water becomes violent and choppy when it hits a barrier. Go to Angelo. Pretend to yield to his request, and obey his demands to the letter. But set some conditions: that you not spend much time together, that it be in the dark, that there be absolute silence, and that it be in a convenient place. When he agreesand now heres the key partwell tell the wronged girl to go in your place. If their encounter later comes to light, it might compel him to compensate her. The result of all this: your brother is saved, your honor is maintained, poor Mariana is helped, and the corrupt deputy is punished. Ill prepare the girl and make her ready for the encounter. If you think you can manage this, the double benefit outweighs any blame for the deception. What do you think?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
I like the idea already, and I hope itll be successful.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
A lot depends on your ability to pull it off. Hurry over to Angelo. If he begs you to sleep with him tonight, promise to satisfy him. Ill go to Saint Lukes; poor Mariana is living there, in a country house. Arrange things with Angelo and come see me there, the sooner the better.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Thank you for your help. Goodbye, good father.
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
No, but if you go on buying and selling men and women like beasts, everyone in the world will end up spawning bastards.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Oh, heavens! What nonsense is this?
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Lifes become a lot less fun since the law took two crimesprostitution and moneylendingand suppressed the one that was the most fun, while condoning the worse of the two. The thriving moneylender wraps himself in a warm fur coat, made of skins from the innocent lamb and trimmed in fur from the crafty fox, proving that craftiness is worth more than innocence.
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
Come along, sir. Bless you, good father friarthis greeting makes no sense since friar means brother, hence the Dukes mocking responsefather friar.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
And you, good brother father. How has this man offended you, sir?
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
Actually, sir, he has offended the law. And, sir, we
take him to be a thief too, sir, because we found
on him, sir, a strange device for picking lockspresumably for picking the locks on chastity beltspicking locks, which we have sent to the deputy.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
(to POMPEY) Shame, sirraha title used to address a male inferiorsirrah! A pimp, a wicked pimp! You support yourself by doing evil. Do you ever stop to think what it is to stuff your mouth or clothe your back from such a filthy vice? Say to yourself, I eat, dress myself, and live off abominable, beastly sex. Can you believe your way of life is a life, when its dependent on such stinking acts? Change your ways, change your ways.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Yes, it does stink in a way, sir; but, sir, I would prove
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
No, if the devil has given you excuses for sin, youll prove only that you belong to him. Take him to prison, officer. Punishment and religion must both be used on this crude beast before he improves.
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
He has to appear before the deputy, sir, whos already given him a warning. The deputy cant stand pimps, and if he is a pimp, and appears before him, he would be better off being anywhere but there.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
If only we were allas some of us seem to beas free from sin as this pimp is from hypocrisy!
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
Like your waistfriars robes were tied at the waist with a belt made of rope or cordLike your waist, his neck will soon have a rope around it, sir.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
I see help comingand bail. Heres a gentleman and a
friend of mine.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Hey there, noble Pompey! Oh dear, are you being paraded like a prisoner-of-war after the victorious Caesars chariot? What, arent there any more girls just turned women who can be had for a handful of dollars? Ha, dont you have any answers? How do you feel about the new regime? Puts quite a damper on things, right? What do you say, old man? Hasnt the world changed? Whats your mood nowadays, a bit sad and silent? Or how? Whats the plan?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
This is getting worse and worse.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Hows my sweetheart, your boss-lady? Is she still a madam?
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Truthfully, sir, shes worn out all her prostitutes, and is herself getting treated for an STD.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Thats right, thats the way it goes: your fresh-faced whore ages into a heavily made-up madam. Its unavoidable. Are you going to prison, Pompey?
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
I am indeed, sir.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Not a bad thing, Pompey. Goodbye. Go and say I
sent you. For debt, Pompey? Or something else?
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
For being a pimp, for being a pimp.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Well, then, put him in jail: if imprisonment is the punishment for being a pimp, then he deserves it. Hes undoubtedly a pimp, and has been for a long time. Born a pimp. Goodbye, good Pompey. Give my regards to prison. Youll be a good husband now, Pompeyyoull never leave home.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
I hope, sir, youll post bail for me.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
No, I wont, Pompey. Its not in style now. I will pray, Pompey, to increase your sentence. Show an iron will while youre in iron chains. AdieuFrench for goodbye Adieu , Pompey. God bless you, friar.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
And you.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Does Bridget still get dolled up, Pompey, ha?
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
Come along, sir, come.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
You wont bail me out, then, sir?
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Neither then, Pompey, nor now. Whats happening, friar?
Whats the news?
</T>
<T>
ELBOW
Come along, sir, come.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Off to the doghouse, Pompey. Go.
</T>
<T>
Any news, friar, of the duke?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
I dont know anything. Can you tell me any news?
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Some say hes with the emperor of Russia. Others say that hes in Rome. Where do you think he is?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
I dont know, but wherever he is, I wish him well.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
It was a crazy whim of his to sneak away from the city and pretend to be the commoner he was never born to be. Lord Angelo runs things well in his absencehes hard on criminals.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
He does a good job of it.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
It wouldnt hurt him to go a little easier on sex. Theres something too harsh in the way hes handling that, friar.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
It is too widespread a vice. It needs a severe cure.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Yes, to tell the truth, this is a vice a lot of people practice. But its impossible to stamp it out totally, friar. Youd have to stop people eating and drinking first. They say this Angelo wasnt the result of a normal act between a man and woman. Do you think thats true?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
What was he the result of, then?
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Some say a mermaid gave birth to him, some that he was conceived by two dried codfish. But its a fact that when he pees, his urine is congealed ice. That I know to be true. And hes an impotent puppetthats certain.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Youre a funny guy, sir, and speak freely.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Well, what a cruel thing for him to do, to take a mans life because his penis rose up! Would the absent duke have done something like this? Before he wouldve hanged a man for fathering a hundred bastards, he wouldve paid for nursing a thousand. He had some understanding of prostitution. He knew the game, and that made him merciful.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
I never heard the absent duke accused of womanizing. He wasnt inclined that way.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Oh, sir, youre wrong.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Thats not possible.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Who, the duke? Yes, your fifty-year-old beggar-womanhed habitually make a deposit in her dish. The duke was a little kinky. Hed get drunk, too, let me tell you.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Surely, youre being unfair to him.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Sir, I was a close friend of his. The duke was a shy fellow, and I believe I know the reason for his sudden departure.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
What, please tell me, was the reason?
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
No, sorry. Its a secret that must stay locked in my mouth. But this I can tell you: the majority of his subjects thought the duke a wise man.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Wise! Well, theres no doubt that he was.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
A very superficial, ignorant, thoughtless fellow.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Youre either jealous, mad, or mistaken. The way he conducts his life and his role as a ruler by themselves must earn him a better reputation. Judge him by his public actions and even the envious would see him as a scholar, a statesman, and a soldier. So, you dont know what youre talking about. Or, if you do, youre spitefully trying to tarnish his name.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Sir, I know him, and I love him.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
If you loved him you would know him better, and if you knew him better you would love him more.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Look, sir, I know what I know.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
I can hardly believe that, since you dont know what youre talking about. But, if the duke ever returns, as we pray he will, I challenge you to justify your comments in front of him. If youve spoken the truth, you should have the courage to defend it. Its my duty to summon you to testify. May I ask your name?
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Sir, my name is Lucio, and its well known to the duke.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Hell know you even better, sir, if I live to report you.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Im not afraid of you.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Oh, you hope the duke will never come back, or you think Im too weak an enemy. But I really can do you a little harmyoull end up denying this.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Ill be hanged first. Youre wrong about me, friar. But forget all this. Can you tell me if Claudio is to die tomorrow or not?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Why should he die, sir?
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Why? For plugging a hole. I wish the duke were back again. His sexless deputys abstinence policy will depopulate the province. Even sparrows cant nest on his roof, because theyre lecheroussparrows were considered sacred to Venus, Goddess of Love, and thus symbols of sexbecause theyre lecherous! The duke would have punished sexual acts privatelyhed never publicly expose them. I wish he were back! Claudio is condemned for getting undressed. Goodbye, good friar. Please pray for me. I tell you again, the duke was no choir boyhe would eat mutton on Fridaysa pun, referring both to eating meat (mutton) on Fridaysforbidden to Catholicsand to visiting prostitutes, called mutton in Elizabethan slanghe would eat mutton on Fridays. Hes not past it yet, and I tell you, hed French-kiss a beggar, even if she smelled of moldy bread and garlic. Say that I said so. Goodbye.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Neither political power nor noble character can escape criticism; even the most virtuous person can be stabbed in the back by slurs. What king is so strong he can bottle up the poison of a slandering tongue? But whos coming now?
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Go on, take her to prison!
</T>
<T>
MISTRESS OVERDONE
My good lord, be good to me. Your honor is said to be that of a merciful man, my good lord.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Youve been warned two, three times, and youre still committing the same crime! This is enough to turn mercy itself into a cursing tyrant.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
A madam for eleven years, your honor.
</T>
<T>
MISTRESS OVERDONE
My lord, this is Lucios accusation against me. He got Miss Kate Keepdown pregnant, back in the days when the duke was still here, and he promised to marry her. Now his child will be fifteen months old on May Day. I kept the kid myself, and now see how he goes out of his way to abuse me!
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
That fellow is a dangerous fellow. Bring him before me. Take her away to prison! No more talking.
</T>
<T>
Provost, my colleague Angelo wont change his mindClaudio must die tomorrow. Furnish him with priests, to give him spiritual consolation. If my colleague possessed my sense of pity, this wouldnt be happening.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
This friars been with him, and helped him prepare for death.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Good evening, good father.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Bliss and goodness to you!
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Where are you from?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Not from this country, though I happen to be here for the time being. I belong to a holy brotherhood, and have just come from Rome, on special business from the Vatican.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Whats the news from abroad?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
None, except that goodness is so sick that only death can cure it. People only want the latest thing, and its as dangerous to be faithful as it is virtuous to be promiscuous. Theres barely enough honesty left for it to be safe to get involved with people, but theres enough blind trust to doom partnerships. The wisdom of the world runs on paradoxes like this. Its old news, but everyday news. Tell me, sir, what sort of man was the duke?
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Someone who, above everything else, truly wanted to know himself.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
What sort of things did he enjoy?
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
He enjoyed seeing someone else happy more than doing something that made himself happyan even-tempered man. But lets leave him to his affairs, with a prayer that theyll be prosperous, and tell me how Claudio is. I understand youve visited him.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
He claims to have received no unfair treatment from his judge, but willingly yields to the laws verdict. Out of human weakness, hed formed many deceptive hopes about a reprieve. But gradually I showed him these made no sense, and now he is ready to die.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
You have fulfilled your duty to both God and the prisoner. I pleaded for the poor man as much as I could, without giving offense, but my fellow judge is so severe, I swear, hes like Justice itself.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
If his own behavior matches the strictness of his judgments, its to his credit. But if he slips, hes written his own sentence.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Im going to visit the prisoner. Goodbye.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Peace be with you!
</T>
<T>
(to himself) He who wants to be a ruler and enact heavens justice should be as holy as he is severe. He should find in himself a model of proper conduct, the grace to stand firm, and the strength to go forward, punishing others no more or less than hed punish his own sins. Shame on him who cruelly strikes and kills others for the very faults he possesses! Shame on Angelo six times over, for weeding out my vice while nurturing his own! Oh, what evil an angelic-looking man can hide in himself! How this seemingly virtuous behavior, born out of sin, can deceive everyone! Its like a spider web that traps small sins like small insects, but breaks when anything large and heavy touches it. I must combat vice with cunning. Tonight Angelo will sleep with his rejected, former fiance. By deceit, the deceiver will be forced to pay for his wrongful demands, and fulfill his old contract.
</T>
<T>
BOY
(singing) Take, oh take those lips away, that swore such sweet lies,
and those eyes, which trick the morning by shining bright as the sun at dawn. But give back, give back my kisses, which seal my love, but seal it in vain, seal it in vain.
</T>
<T>
MARIANA
Stop singing, and leave, quickly. Here comes a man whose advice has often calmed me down.
</T>
<T>
I beg your pardon, sir. I wish you hadnt found me listening to music. Please excuse me, and believe me, it drove away my joy and nurtured my sorrow.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Thats good, though music often has a magical power to make the bad seem good and encourage good people to misbehave. Please tell me, has anybody been asking for me here today? I promised to meet someone here about this time.
</T>
<T>
MARIANA
No ones been asking for you. Ive been sitting here all day.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
I believe you; shes here now. May I ask you to leave for a little while? Ill be with you shortly, and itll be to your advantage.
</T>
<T>
MARIANA
Im always grateful to you.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Welcomeand perfect timing. Whats the news from our favorite deputy?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
He has a garden surrounded by a brick wall, whose western side is backed by a vineyard. Leading to that vineyard is a gate of wooden planks that you open with this larger key. This other key opens a little door that leads from the vineyard to the garden. Ive promised to meet him there, in the dark middle of the night.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
But do you know how to find the way there?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Ive noted it carefullyhe gave me the directions twice, whispering the details with care and using gestures to explain.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Are there any other agreed-on signals she has to give?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
No, none, only a visit in the dark. And Ive let him know I can only stay a short time, because I told him a servant would be waiting for me, under the pretense that I was coming about my brother.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Youve handled it well. I havent told Mariana a word of this yet. Hey, you in there! Come here!
</T>
<T>
(to MARIANA) Please, let me introduce you to this girl. Shes here to help you.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Thats what I want to do.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Do you believe that Ive got your best interests at heart?
</T>
<T>
MARIANA
Good friar, I know you do, and that youve found a way to help.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Then take the hand of your new friend, who has a tale to tell you. Ill wait for you until youre ready, but hurry nights falling.
</T>
<T>
MARIANA
Will you walk with me?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Oh, you people of high rank! Millions of treacherous eyes
are fixed on you, accompanied by a mass of hostile rumors that follow everything you do. A thousand imaginations make you the source of their silly fantasies and torture you with their delusions.
</T>
<T>
Welcome back. What did you decide?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Shell do it, father, if you recommend it.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
I dont just recommend it. I beg her to do it.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
When you leave him, all you have to do is say softly, Now remember my brother.
</T>
<T>
MARIANA
Dont worry about me.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
And, gentle daughter, dont worry for yourself. He is your husband-to-be, so its no sin for you two to sleep togetheryour valid claim as his wife allows the deception. Come on, lets go. We have to sow the seeds before we can reap the harvest.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Come here, you. Can you cut off a mans head?
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
If the mans a bachelor, sir, I can. But if hes a
married man, hes also his wifes head, and I can never cut off a womans head.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Come on, sir, spare me your jokes and give me a straight answer. Claudio and Barnardine are to die tomorrow morning. Here in our prison we have a public executioner, who needs a helper. If youll take on the job of assisting him, itll free you from your chains. If you dont, youll have to serve your full sentence, with a fierce whipping before youre released because youve been a notorious pimp.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Sir, Ive been an illegal pimp for longer than I can remember, but Ill be happy to be a legal hangman. Id be glad for my new partner to teach me.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Hey, Abhorsonthe name combines the words abhor and whoreson (son of a whore)Abhorson! Where are you, Abhorson?
ABHORSON (the executioner) enters.
</T>
<T>
ABHORSON
Did you call, sir?
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Heres a fellow to help you with tomorrows executions. If he works out, settle on an annual salary and let him stay here with you. If he doesnt, use him just for now and then fire him. He cant claim to be too good for the work since hes been a pimp.
</T>
<T>
ABHORSON
A pimp, sir? To hell with him! Hell discredit our profession.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Go on, sir. You two are worth the same. No more than a featherweights difference, anyway.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Sir, would you pleasefor you do have a pleasing face, except for your hanging expressiontell me if you call your job a profession?
</T>
<T>
ABHORSON
Yes, sir, a profession.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Ive heard it said that painting, sir, is a profession, and since whoreswho are in my fieldpaint their faces, they prove my occupation is a profession. But Ill be hanged if I can imagine how hanging is a profession.
</T>
<T>
ABHORSON
Sir, it is a profession.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Can you prove it?
</T>
<T>
ABHORSON
A thief steals and puts on the clothes of an honest man. If the thief thinks the clothes dont make him seem honest enough, a truly honest man will think thats appropriate. If the thief thinks the clothes make him seem extra honest, then the thief thinks the disguise fits just right. So someone is always happy with the way the disguise works for the thief.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Have you reached an agreement?
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Sir, Ill work for him, because I think a hangmans job is a sorrier one than a pimpshe asks forgiveness more oftenan executioner traditionally asked the condemned person to forgive him just before the executionhe asks forgiveness more often.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
You, fellow, have your block and your axe ready tomorrow at four oclock.
</T>
<T>
ABHORSON
Come on, pimp, Ill show you the ropes. Follow me.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
I want to learn, sir. And I hope, if you ever get the chance to use me for your own execution, youll find me ready. Because, really, I owe you a good turn for your kindness.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Call Barnardine and Claudio here. I pity one, but not the other, even if he were my brother, as hes a murderer.
</T>
<T>
Look, Claudio, heres your death warrant. Its now dead midnight, and by 8 a.m. tomorrow you must be laid to eternal rest. Wheres Barnardine?
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
As fast asleep as the most innocent of exhausted laborers. He wont wake up.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Who could do him any good, anyway? Well, go, prepare yourself.
(knocking is heard offstage)
</T>
<T>
Whats that noise? (to Claudio) Heaven give your spirits comfort!
</T>
<T>
In a minute. I hope its some pardon or reprieve for gentle Claudio.
</T>
<T>
Welcome, father.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
The best, most wholesome night spirits surround you, good Provost! Whos been here lately?
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
No one, since the curfew bellrung at 9:00 p.m.curfew bell rang.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Not Isabel?
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
No.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Someone will be, then, before long.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Is there any news to give comfort to Claudio?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Theres comfort in hope.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Angelos a cruel deputy.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
No, no. His life parallels the same straight line that his mighty justice draws. With religious restraint, he suppresses in himself the same impulses he persecutes in others. If he were stained with the sort of sins he punishes, then hed be a tyrant. But because hes virtuous, hes fair.
(knocking is heard offstage)
</T>
<T>
Theyre here.
</T>
<T>
This provost is a nice man. Its rare that a hardened jailer has sympathy for his fellow men.
(knocking is heard offstage)
</T>
<T>
What is that noise? That messengers so impatient hes going to hurt that poor door with his knocking.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Hes stuck there until the officer at the gate wakes up to let him in. The officers up now.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Havent you received any order yet countermanding Claudios execution tomorrow?
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
None, sir, none.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Even though its almost dawn, provost, youll have news before morning.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Perhaps you know something. But I dont think any reprieve is coming. Theres no precedent for it. Besides, Lord Angelo declared the opposite, in public, from the judges bench.
</T>
<T>
This is his lordships servant.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
And here comes Claudios pardon.
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
(presenting a paper) My lord has sent you this note, and charged me to tell you not to swerve from the smallest item in itnot the time, details, or anything else. Good morning, since I gather its almost morning.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
I will obey him.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
(to himself) This is his pardon, bought by the same sin Angelo committed. Crimes spread quickly when those in power perpetrate them as well. When evildoers extend mercy, they widen mercys grasp, pardoning other sinners because they love the sin. Now, sir, whats the news?
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
I told you. Lord Angelo, thinking me careless in my duties maybe, is putting unusual pressure on me. Its strangehes never done this before.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Please, lets hear the letter.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
(reads) Whatever you may hear to the contrary, have
Claudio executed by four oclock, and Barnardine in the
afternoon. Reassure me by sending me Claudios head by five oclock. Be sure you do it, and be aware that more depends on it than I can reveal at this time. Dont fail to do your duty, or you will be held accountable. What do you say to this, sir?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Who is this Barnardine whos to be executed in the
afternoon?
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
He was born in Bohemia, but raised here. Hes been a prisoner for the last nine years.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
How did it happen that the absent duke neither freed him nor executed him? Ive heard he usually does one or the other.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Barnardines friends kept getting him reprieves. And there was no clear evidence that he was actually guilty, until now, when Angelo came to power.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Its clear now?
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Very clear, and he doesnt deny it himself.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Has he shown remorse while in prison? What effect has it had on him?
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Hes a man who fears death as no worse than a drunken sleep. Hes careless, reckless, and fearless of the past, present, or future. Hes unaware of the concept of death, and desperately clinging to life.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
He needs counseling.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
He wont listen to any. Hes always had the freedom to go anywhere inside the prison. If you gave him a chance to escape, he wouldnt run. Hes drunk many times a day, or spends many days entirely drunk. Often, weve woken him up, as if to take him to be executed, and shown him a pretend warrant. Its never affected him at all.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
More of him soon. Provost, I see honesty and loyalty in your face. If Im wrong, my old skill at reading people deceives me, but because Im confident of my ability, Ill take a chance. Claudio, whom you have a warrant to execute, deserves to die no more than Angelo, who sentenced him. I can clearly demonstrate this, but I need four days, so Im going to ask you to do me an immediate and dangerous favor.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
What is it, sir?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Delay the death.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Sorry, but how can I, with the time fixed and an explicit command to deliver his head to Angelo, at risk of penalty? Ill find myself in Claudios shoes if I swerve from this in even the smallest way.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
By my holy vows, I guarantee your safety if you follow my instructions. Execute this Barnardine this morning, and take his head to Angelo.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Angelos seen both of them, and will recognize the face.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Oh, deaths a great disguiser, and you can help disguise him more. Shave his head and trim his beard, and say it was the prisoners request to be shaved before his death. You know thats a common thing. If anything happens to you because of thisaside from thanks and good fortune by the patron saint of my brotherhood, Ill plead against it with my life.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Forgive me, good father. Its against my oath.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Did you swear allegiance to the duke, or to the deputy?
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
To him, and to his representatives.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Will you think youve done nothing wrong if the duke vouches for the justice of your action?
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
But how likely is that?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Not a possibility, but a certainty. Yet since I see
youre afraid, that neither my religious robes, integrity, nor arguments can easily persuade you, Ill go
farther than I meant to, to dispel all your fears. (displays a letter) Look, sir, heres the dukes handwriting and seal. You recognize them both, Im sure.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
I know them both.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
This letters contents describe the dukes return; you can read it over at your leisure, and youll learn that hell be here in two days. Angelo doesnt know this, since today hell be getting some letters with strange news, maybe about the dukes death, maybe about him entering some monasterybut nothing about whats written here. Look, the morning star is out. Dont be confused by all this. Everything makes sense after its been done. Call your executioner, and off with Barnardines head. Ill give him confession, and prepare him for a better place. Youre still stunned, but this absolutely will explain everything to you. Lets go, its almost dawn.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Ive got as many friends here as I did back at the brothel. Youd think it were Mistress Overdones very own house, so many of her old customers are here. First, heres young Mister Hasty; hes in for debt, having paid 197 pounds for some coarse brown paper and old ginger candy, and making back only three pounds selling it. Gingerginger was considered an aphrodisiac for older womenGinger wasnt much in demand, because the old ladies were all dead. Then theres one Mister Pirouette, defendant in a suit about four suits, brought by Mister Thick Velvet, the textile merchant. Hes being impeached over peach-colored satin. Then weve also got young Ditsy, and young Mister Cross-My-Heart, and Mister Cubic Zirconia and Mister Cheapskate, armed to fight duels, and young Kill-Heir who murdered robust Stuffed-Guts, and Mister Forward-Thrust the fighter, and dressed-to-kill Mister Shoe-Buckle, the world-traveler, and wild Half-Pint who stabbed Pots, and, I think, forty more gentsall great clients of our business, who now sing that old prison refrain, Give us food for the Lords sake.
</T>
<T>
ABHORSON
You there, bring Barnardine here.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Mister Barnardine! Youve got to get up, and get onto the scaffold. Mister Barnardine!
</T>
<T>
ABHORSON
Hey, Barnardine!
</T>
<T>
BARNARDINE
(offstage) Damn your throats! Whos making all that noise? Who are you?
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Your friends, sir, the hangmen. Please be so
good, sir, as to rise and be put to death.
</T>
<T>
BARNARDINE
(offstage) Go away, scoundrel. Away! Im sleepy.
</T>
<T>
ABHORSON
Tell him he has to wake up, and quickly too.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Please, Mister Barnardine, stay awake till youre
executed, and sleep afterwards.
</T>
<T>
ABHORSON
Get in there and fetch him.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Hes coming, sir, hes coming. I hear the straw on his cell floor rustling.
</T>
<T>
ABHORSON
Is the axe on the block, man?
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Very ready, sir.
</T>
<T>
BARNARDINE
How goes it, Abhorson? Whats the news with you?
</T>
<T>
ABHORSON
Actually, sir, Id like you to get on with your prayers, because the warrants arrived.
</T>
<T>
BARNARDINE
You jerk, Ive been drinking all night. Im not ready for it.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Oh, all the better, sir, for he who drinks all night
and is hanged early in the morning may sleep better all the next day.
</T>
<T>
ABHORSON
Look, sir, here comes your holy confessor. Think were joking now?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Sir, out of my sense of charity, and hearing how hastily
you have to leave, I came to advise you, comfort
you, and pray with you.
</T>
<T>
BARNARDINE
Not me, friar. Ive been drinking hard all night, and either I get more time to prepare, or theyll have to beat out my brains with clubs. I wont agree to die today, thats for sure.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Oh, sir, you must, and so I beg you to look forward to the journey youre going on.
</T>
<T>
BARNARDINE
I swear I will not die today, no matter who tries to persuade me.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
But listen
</T>
<T>
BARNARDINE
Not a word: if you got anything to say to me,
come to my cell. Im not leaving it today.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Unfit to live or die, that stony heart! After him, boys. Bring him to the block.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Now, sir, how is the prisoner?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
A creature unprepared, unfit for death. To send him off in his current frame of mind would be damnable.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Here in prison, father, a notorious pirate named Ragozine just died this morning of a terrible fever. He was Claudios age, with the same color beard and hair. What if we forget about this reprobate until hes agreeable, and send the deputy Ragozines head, which is more like Claudios?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Oh, this is a heaven-sent chance! Do it at once. Its getting near the time Angelo set for the execution. See that its done, and the head sent, as ordered. Meanwhile, Ill persuade this uncivilized wretch to die willingly.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Well do it, good father, immediately. But Barnardine must die this afternoon. And what do we do with Claudio, to save me from the danger of word getting out that hes alive?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Lets do this: put both Barnardine and Claudio in secret cells. Before two more days, itll be obvious youre safe.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Im in your hands.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Hurry, get the head and send it to Angelo.
</T>
<T>
Now Ill write letters to Angelo. The provost can deliver them. Theyll say Im close to home and its of the utmost importance that I make a big public entrance. Ill ask him to meet me at the holy springs three miles out of town. And from there, step by cool step, and observing all the proper procedures, Ill deal with Angelo.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Heres the head. Ill carry it myself.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Suitable, isnt it? Come back soon, because I want to talk with you about things that are for your ears only.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Ill be as fast as I can.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
(offstage) Hello! Peace to all here!
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Thats Isabels voice. Shes here to see if her brothers pardon has come yet. But Ill hide the news for her own good, to turn her despair into divine comfort when she least expects it.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
May I come in?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
All the better a morning when so holy a man says it to me. Has the deputy sent my brothers pardon yet?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
He has released him, Isabel, from the world. His head is off and sent to Angelo.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
No, its not true.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
It is. Be smart, daughter, and keep control of yourself.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Oh, Ill go and tear his eyes out!
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
They wont let you see him.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Unhappy Claudio! Wretched Isabel! Cruel world! Damned Angelo!
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
This neither hurts him nor helps you a bit. Control yourself and leave your case to heaven. Pay attention to what I say. Every syllable is truth you can rely on. The dukes coming home tomorrowno, dry your eyes. His confessor, who belongs to our monastery, gave me this information. Hes already sent word to Escalus and Angelo, who are preparing to meet him at the gates and surrender their authority to him there. If you can, steer your mind along the path I want it to follow. Youll have your desire inflicted on this wretch, the favor of the duke, revenge to your hearts content, and general acclaim.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Ill do whatever you say.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Then give this letter to Friar Peter. Its the one he sent me about the dukes return. Itll be a sign that I want to meet him at Marianas house tonight. Ill tell him all about her case and yours, and hell bring you before the duke, and you can thoroughly accuse Angelo face-to-face. My poor self is bound by a sacred vow, so I wont be there. (giving the letter) Go with this letter. Banish those worried tears with a light heart. Never trust my holy order again if I steer you wrong. Whos here?
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Good evening. Friar, wheres the provost?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Not inside, sir.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Oh, pretty Isabella, Im sick at heart to see your eyes so red, but try to calm down. I have to dine on plain bread and waterto control my desire, I dont fill my belly, since one big meal would get me excited. But they say the duke will be here tomorrow. I swear, Isabel, I loved your brother. If the good old whimsical duke, who loved to fool around in dark places, had been at home, Claudio wouldve lived.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Sir, the duke is nothing at all like you report.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Friar, you dont know the duke as well as I do. Hes more of a womanizer than you think.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Well, youll pay for this one day. Goodbye.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
No, wait. Ill go along with you. I can tell you some great tales about the duke.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Youve already told me too many, sir, if theyre true. If theyre not true, I dont want to hear any.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
I appeared before him once for getting a girl pregnant.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Did you do such a thing?
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Yes, I did, but I denied it under oath. They wouldve made me marry the rotten whore otherwise.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Sir, you look a lot nicer than you are. Goodbye.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
I swear, Ill go with you to the end of the lane. If dirty talk offends you, well avoid it. No, friar, Im like a kind of burrIll stick to you.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Every letter hes written has contradicted the others.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
In a very vague, inconsistent way. His behavior seems almost insanepray God hes not going mad! And why do we have to meet him at the gates, and surrender our authority there?
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
I cant guess.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
And why, an hour before his arrival, should we announce that if anyone wants compensation for unjust treatment, they should come ready to present their petitions publicly?
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
He gives a reason for that: to be able to deal promptly with the complaints, and to save us from future lawsuits.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Well, I urge you to announce it early in the morning. Ill come pick you up at your house. Alert all the high-ranking officials who are supposed to meet him.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
I will, sir. Goodbye.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Good night.
</T>
<T>
This thing Ive done has totally destroyed me. Im stupid, cant concentrate on anything. A girl robbed of her virginity, and by a respected public figure who enforced the law against sex! If she werent too ashamed to admit it, she could easily denounce me! But her head tells her not to, because my credibility is so strong that any scandal would ruin the person who spreads it, not me. I wouldve let Claudio live, except that a hotheaded youth like him might have come after me someday, feeling that his life is dishonored because he paid such a shameful price for it. Even so, I wish Id let him live. Sadly, nothing goes right once we forget virtue. I dont do the good thing, which I dont want to do, but the evil I dont want to commit, that I do.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
At the right time, deliver these letters for me.
</T>
<T>
The provost knows about my plan. Once things get going, remember your orders and follow my lead, though sometimes you can deviate from the plan, if it seems appropriate. Go to Flavius house, and tell him where Im staying. Inform Valentinus, Rowland, and Crassus, too, and ask them to bring the trumpeters to the gate. But send me Flavius first.
</T>
<T>
FRIAR PETER
Ill do it right away.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Thanks, Varrius, you got here fast. Lets get going. More of our friends will be here soon, honorable Varrius.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
I hate to speak so evasively. Id rather tell the truth. But to accuse Angelo is your job, the friar says, and he advises me to lie, to hide our real aim.
</T>
<T>
MARIANA
We should do as he says.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Besides, he tells me that I shouldnt think it strange if he happens to contradict me. Itll be like swallowing a bitter pill that offers a sweet cure.
</T>
<T>
MARIANA
I wish Friar Peter
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Oh, wait! The friars here.
</T>
<T>
FRIAR PETER
Come on, Ive found you a good place to stand, where youll be so positioned that the duke wont be able to bypass you. The trumpets have blown twice, the most high-born and important people have already gathered at the gates, and the dukes about to enter. So, lets go!
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
(to Angelo) My fellow nobleman, welcome!
(to Escalus) My faithful old friend, Im glad to see you.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO, ESCALUS
Welcome home, your royal grace!
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Many hearty thanks to you both. Ive been asking about you, and Ive heard such good things about your rule that I just had to thank you publicly, as a preview of more rewards to come.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
You make my debt to you even greater.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Oh, youre extremely worthy, and itd be wrong of me to hide it in my heart, when it deserves to be written in brass letters, as on a monument, where time cant erase it. Give me your hand, and let the people see, so theyll know how proud I am to display my high regard for you. Come, Escalus, you must walk with me on my other side. You make a fine supporterin heraldry, one of the figures that holds up a shield (as in a coat of arms, for instance)supporter.
</T>
<T>
FRIAR PETER
Nows the time: speak up and kneel before him.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Justice, royal duke! Look down here, at a girlI wish I could say a virginwho has been wronged. Oh, worthy prince, dont consider anything else until youve heard my valid case and given me justice, justice, justice, justice!
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Describe how youve been wrongedin what way? By whom? Be brief. Lord Angelo here will give you justice. Tell him your complaint.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Oh, worthy duke, youre urging me to ask the devil for help. Listen to me yourself. What I have to say will result either in you not believing and punishing me, or you feeling compelled to right the wrong. Hear me, oh hear me, here!
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
My lord, Im afraid shes not in her right mind. Shes appeared before me, begging for her brother, who was executed by the justice system
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
By the justice system!
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
And she will speak in a very bitter, strange way.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Ill speak strangely, but truthfully. That Angelos a liar, isnt that strange? That Angelos a murderer, isnt that strange? That Angelos an adulterous thief, a hypocrite, a man who rapes virgins, isnt that extremely strange?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Thats strange to the tenth degree.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Its just as true as the fact that hes Angelo, and this is all as true as it is strange. No, its true to the tenth degree, for the truth is the truth, no matter how much you multiply it.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Take her away! Poor soul, shes insane.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Oh, prince, I beg you, as you believe in a better world than this one, dont dismiss me by thinking Im mad! Dont assume somethings impossible because its unlikely. Its not impossible that the wickedest wretch on the face of the earth may look just as cautious, as dignified, as fair, as perfect as Angeloeven as Angelo, for all his official finery, badges, titles, and ceremonies, can be an arch-villain. Believe it, royal prince. If hes less than a wretch, hes nothing. But hes more, if only I had more names for badness.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
I declare, if shes madas I believe she isher madness has an oddly rational sound. Ive rarely heard such coherent logic from someone insane.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Oh, gracious duke, dont harp on that. But dont dismiss rational statements because they dont jibe with appearances. Use your intelligence to uncover the hidden truth, which is obscured by lies that seem like truth.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
A lot of sane people make a lot less sense. What would you like to say?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
I am the sister of one Claudio, sentenced to die by the decree against fornicationsentenced by Angelo. I was about to enter a convent, when my brother contacted me. He sent me a message through a man named Lucio
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Thats me, if it please your grace: I came to her from Claudio, and asked her to try her good luck in asking Lord Angelo for her poor brothers pardon.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Yes, thats the man.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
No one asked you to speak.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
No, my good lord, but no one asked me to be quiet, either.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Im asking you now, then. Remember it. And when you have your own business before me, pray heaven you behave yourself.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Ill take notice, your honor.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
The notice is for yourself. Pay attention to it.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
This gentleman has told some of my story
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Right.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
It may be right, but youre wrong to interrupt. Proceed.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
I went to this wicked, evil deputy
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Youre sounding crazy.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Excuse methe choice of words is appropriate.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Thats better. Continue.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
To make a long story shortbecause it took a while, how I begged, how I prayed and kneeled, how he refused me, and how I repliedIll sadly and shamefully get to the awful ending. He wouldnt release my brother unless I gave my chaste body over to his yearning lust. And after much internal debate, my sisterly pity overcame my honor, and I gave in to him. But having got what he wanted, early the next morning he sent an order for my poor brothers head.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
(sarcastically) This is very believable!
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Oh, I wish it were as believable as it is true!
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Heavens above, you poor fool, you dont know what youre saying, or else youve been bribed to falsely accuse him. First of all, his integrity is beyond reproach. Next, it makes no sense that he should so vigorously prosecute crimes he himself commits. If he had committed such a crime, he wouldve judged your brother against himself, and not executed him. Someone has put you up to this. Confess the truth, and tell us who urged you to come here with this accusation.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Thats it? Then, oh, you blessed angels above, help me be patient, and let time reveal the evil hiding here behind appearances! Heaven protect your grace from harm. Since you dont believe me, I have to go.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
I bet youd like to go. Officer, take her to prison! Should I permit such destructive, scandalous rumors about someone so close to me? This must be a conspiracy. Who knew about your plan, and that you were coming here?
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Someone I wish were here now, Friar Lodowick.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
A holy ghost, probably. Who knows this Lodowick?
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
My lord, I know him. Hes the sort of friar whos always meddling in peoples business. I dont like the man. If he hadnt been a member of the clergy, I would have punched him out for certain words he spoke against your grace while you were away.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Words against me? Some holy friar this is! And to set this wretched woman here against my replacement! Someone locate this friar.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Just yesterday, my lord, I saw her and this friar at the prison. Hes a smart-aleck, a very nasty piece of work.
</T>
<T>
FRIAR PETER
God bless your royal grace! Ive stood by, my lord, and Ive heard your royal ears deceived. First, this woman has wrongfully accused your replacement, who is as far from any sexual or moral misbehavior with her as she is from a virgin birth.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
I never believed anything else. Do you know this Friar Lodowick shes talking about?
</T>
<T>
FRIAR PETER
I know him for a divine and holy man, not lowdown, and not someone who meddles in earthly pleasures, as this gentleman reports. And, trust me, hes a man that never slandered your grace.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
My lord, he did, and very maliciously too. Believe it.
</T>
<T>
FRIAR PETER
Well, in time he may come to clear himself, but at this instant hes sick, my lord, suffering a rare fever. Learning there was an accusation planned against Lord Angelo, he personally asked me to come here and speak, as he would have, about what he knows is true and false. And when hes summoned, hell give his oath and furnish proof that will clear everything up. This worthy nobleman, whos been so publicly and personally accused, will be vindicated, and this woman will be discredited to her face, to such an extent that she herself will have to admit it.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Good friar, lets hear it.
</T>
<T>
Isnt this funny, Lord Angelo? Oh, heaven, the nerve of these wretched fools! Give us some seats. Come, Angelo, my friend. I wont take any part in this. You be the judge of your own case. Is this the witness, friar? First, let her show her face, and then speak.
</T>
<T>
MARIANA
Pardon me, my lord. I will not show my face until my husband bids me to.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
What, are you married?
</T>
<T>
MARIANA
No, my lord.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Are you single?
</T>
<T>
MARIANA
No, my lord.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
A widow, then?
</T>
<T>
MARIANA
Neither, my lord.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
So, you are neither single, widow, nor wife?
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
My lord, she may be a prostitute. Many of them are
neither virgin, widow, nor wife.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Keep that fellow quiet. I wish he were up on some charge of his own.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
OK, my lord.
</T>
<T>
MARIANA
My lord, I do admit Ive never been married, and I also admit Im not a virgin. Ive slept with my husband, but my husband doesnt know hes slept with me.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
He was drunk then, my lord. Thats the best explanation.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
For silences sake, be silent yourself!
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
OK, my lord.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
This is hardly a witness for Lord Angelo.
</T>
<T>
MARIANA
Im coming to it now, my lord. The woman whos accusing him of fornication is actually accusing my husband. And she charges it was at the very time when, as Ill swear, he was in my arms, making love to me.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Is she accusing more men besides me?
</T>
<T>
MARIANA
Not that I know of.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
No? You say your husband.
</T>
<T>
MARIANA
Why, exactly, my lord. Hes Angelo, who believes he never slept with me, and who believes he slept with Isabel.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
This is a strange deception. Lets see your face.
</T>
<T>
MARIANA
My husband bids me to, so Ill lift my veil.
</T>
<T>
This is the face, you cruel Angelo, that you once swore was well worth looking at. This is the hand that was locked in yours with a signed contract. This is the body that kept your appointment with Isabel, and satisfied you in your garden-house, pretending to be her.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Do you know this woman?
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Sexually, she says.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Quiet, you!
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Right, my lord.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
My lord, I must confess I know this woman. Five years ago, there was some talk of marriage between she and I. It was broken off, partly because her dowry fell short of the agreed amount, but mainly because she had a reputation for promiscuity. For the last five years, I havent spoken with her, seen her, or heard from her, I swear.
</T>
<T>
MARIANA
Noble prince, as light comes from heaven and words from breath, as there is meaning in truth and truth in virtue, I am engaged to this man as strongly as words can make vows. And, my good lord, last Tuesday night in a garden house, he treated me as a wife. This being the truth, let me safely rise from my knees, or else let me be fixed here forever, like a marble monument!
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
I was amused up until now, but now my patience is exhausted. My good lord, let me apply the full force of the law. I believe these poor, demented women are just tools of some more powerful person who has put them up to this. Give me the chance, my lord, to unravel this plot.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Yes, with all my heart, and punish them as much as you like. You foolish friar and you wicked woman, in collusion with that one we just took awayeven if you swore by every single saint, do you think your oaths would mean anything against his worthiness and reputation, which are proven beyond a doubt? You, Lord Escalus, sit with my colleague. Do all you can to help him unravel this conspiracy and discover where it came from. Theres another friar who put them up to this. Send for him.
</T>
<T>
FRIAR PETER
I wish he were here, my lord! Because he did encourage the women to make this accusation. Your provost knows where he lives and can go get him.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Go do it, immediately.
</T>
<T>
(to Angelo) And you, my noble and respected friend, who have a stake in seeing this matter to the end, deal with the crimes against you as you think best, with any form of punishment. Ill leave you for a while, but dont move until you have fully decided the fate of these slanderers.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
My lord, well do it thoroughly.
</T>
<T>
Signor Lucio, didnt you say you knew this Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
A hood does not make a monkhis friars clothes are the only holy thing about him. And hes said very evil things about the duke.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Well ask you to stay here until he comes and we lay those charges against him. We think this friars a notorious character.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
As much as anyone in Vienna, on my word.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Call that Isabel here once again. I want to speak with her.
</T>
<T>
Please, my lord, let me do the questioning. Youll see how Ill handle her.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Not better than he, according to her.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
What did you say?
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Frankly, sir, I think, if you handled her privately, shed be more likely to confess. She might be ashamed to do it in public.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Ill keep the matter out of the spotlight.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Thats the way. Women are easiest in the dark.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
(to Isabella) Listen, mi this woman contradicts everything youve said.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
My lord, here comes the rascal I was talking about, with
the provost.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
All in good time. Dont speak to him until we summon you.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Mums the word.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Now, sir, did you egg these women on to slander
Lord Angelo? They have confessed you did.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Its a lie.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
What! Do you know where you are?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
All due respect to your great officeeven the devil gets some respect for being the king of Hell. Wheres the duke? Hes the one who should hear me speak.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
We represent the duke, and we will hear you speak.
See that you speak honestly.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Boldly, at least. But, oh, you poor souls, did you come to find your lambs in the foxs den? Say goodnight to any justice, then. Is the duke gone? Then your case is gone too. The dukes unjust, rejecting your accusation and turning your case over to the very villain you came here
to accuse.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
This is the rascal I was talking about.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Why, you disrespectful and unholy friar, its not enough that youve enlisted these women to accuse this worthy man, but with your foul mouth you call him a villain within his earshot? And then to shift your attack from him to the duke himself, to accuse the duke of being unjust? Take him away, to the rack with him! Well tear you limb from limb, until we discover your motive. To call the duke unjust!
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Dont get so excited. The duke doesnt dare to hurt my little finger any more than hed torture his own. Im not his subject, or a native of this province. My business in this state has made me an on-looker here in Vienna, where Ive seen corruption boil and bubble until it overflows out of the brothels. Youve got laws for all the crimes, but the crimes are so tolerated that the strong statutes are like those joke lists of house rules in storesElizabethan barbers posted mock lists of penalties for customers behaving badly in the shopjoke lists of house rules in storespeople look at them just to laugh.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Slandering the state! Take him away to prison!
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
What evidence do you have against him, Signor Lucio?
Is this the man you told us about?
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Hes the one, my lord. Come here, baldyfriars traditionally shaved their headsbaldy. Do you know me?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice. I
met you at the prison, back when the duke was away.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Oh, you did? And do you remember what you said about the duke?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Definitely, sir.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Do you, sir? And was the duke a pimp, a fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
You must, sir, switch identities with me, before you claim those were my words. You were the one who said that about him, and much more, much worse.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Damn you, fellow! Didnt I smack you in the nose for your comments?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
I swear I love the duke like I love myself.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Look, how the villain would appease us now, after his treasonable slanders!
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
You cant talk to this type of fellow. Take him away to prison! Where is the provost? Take him to prison! Put him in chains, gag him. Away with those loose women, too, and their co-conspirator.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
(to the Provost) Wait, sir, stay a minute.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Is he resisting arrest? Help the provost, Lucio.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Come on, sir. Come on, sir. Come on, sir. Ugh! So, you bald, lying rascal, you want to keep your hood on, do you? Show your lowlife face, damn you! Show your thieving face, and be hanged in an hour! Wont it come off?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Youre the first lowlife to ever turn someone into a duke.
First, provost, let me free these three gentle people. (to LUCIO) Dont you sneak away, sir. The friar and you will have a chat later on. Hold him.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
This may turn out worse than hanging.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
(to ESCALUS) I forgive the things you said to me. Sit down. Well take Angelos seat. (to ANGELO) Sir, if I may. Do you have any words, either intelligent or impudent, that can help you? If so, keep them until I tell my story. Dont hold the truth back any longer.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Oh my dreaded lord, Id be even more guilty to think I could go undiscovered, now that I realize your grace, like some divine power, has seen my sins. So, good prince, stop inquiring about my shame. Let my confession count as my trial. I beg only for the mercy of an immediate sentence and then death.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Come here, Mariana. (to Angelo) Were you ever engaged to this woman?
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
I was, my lord.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Take her and marry her at once. You perform the ceremony, friar, and when its done, bring him back here. Go with him, provost.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
My lord, Im more amazed by Angelos dishonesty than by the strangeness of this situation.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Come here, Isabel. Your friar is now your prince, but my heart hasnt changed with my clothes. I guided and devoted myself to your affairs then, and Im still acting for you now.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
Oh, forgive me! To think that I, your servant, unknowingly used and created problems for your royal person!
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Youre forgiven, Isabel. And now, dear girl, be as generous to me. I know your brothers death hurts you deeply. And you may be wondering why I disguised myself, working behind the scenes to save his life, and didnt just use my authority rather than let him die. Sweet girl, it was the speed of his execution, which I thought would take longer, that ruined my plan. But, peace be with him! The afterlife is a better life, since you dont have to fear death anymore. Try to take comfort in the fact that your brother has that happiness.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
I do, my lord.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
For Marianas sake, you must forgive this newly married man, whose lecherous imagination wronged your well-defended honor. But after he condemned your brother, he committed two crimes, violating your virginity and breaking his promise about the pardon that your brothers life depended on. Even the merciful part of the law cries out, an Angelo for Claudio, death for death! Haste always results in hasty decisions, and deliberation comes from slowness. One thing is rewarded by a similar thing, and the measure of justice you use will be the measure used against you. So, Angelo, your crime is clear for all to see, and it denies you the right to any preferential treatment, even if you yourself feel otherwise. I sentence you to be executed on the very block where Claudio knelt to die, and just as quickly. Take him away!
</T>

MARIANA
Oh, my most gracious lord, please dont make a mockery of my marriage!
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Its your husband whos made a mockery of your marriage. I thought it appropriate that you be married, to protect your honor. Otherwise, revealing that hed slept with you would haunt your life and destroy your future prospects. As for his possessions, technically they belong to the state, but we are giving you a widows rights and bequeathing them to you, to buy you a better husband.
</T>
<T>
MARIANA
Oh my dear lord, I dont want any other man or any better man.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
You shouldnt want him. My decision is final.
</T>
<T>
MARIANA
My gentle lord
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Youre just wasting your time. Take him to his death!
</T>
<T>
Now, sir, about you.
</T>
<T>
MARIANA
Oh, my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my side. Kneel with me, and for the rest of my life Ill be at your service.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
It makes no sense to beg her. If she were to kneel and plead for mercy, her brothers horrified ghost would break through his stone-covered grave and drag her away with him.
</T>
<T>
MARIANA
Isabel, sweet Isabel, just kneel beside me, and hold out your hands. Dont say anything, Ill do all the talking. They say the best men are formed out of their faults, and most of them become much better for being a little bad. That might happen with my husband. Oh, Isabel, wont you kneel?
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
He dies for Claudios death.
</T>
<T>
ISABELLA
(kneeling) Generous sir, please look on this condemned man as if my brother were still alive. To some extent, I think his behavior was sincere, until he laid eyes on me. So, dont let him die. My brother was justly treated, in the sense that he did the thing he was executed for. But Angelo didnt actually fulfill his bad intentions, and his behavior should be considered with that fact in mind. Intentions are merely thoughts, and thoughts arent subject to our control.
</T>
<T>
MARIANA
Merely, my lord.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Your pleadings no use. Stand up, I say. Another crime has just occurred to me. Provost, why was Claudio beheaded at such an unusual hour?
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
It was so ordered.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Did you have a special warrant?
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
No, my good lord, it was a private message.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Youre fired for this. Turn in your keys.
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
Forgive me, noble lord. I thought it might be wrong, but wasnt sure. After further consideration, I did change my mind, and to prove I did, I kept alive another prisoner who was to be executed by a private order.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Whos he?
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
His name is Barnardine.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
I wish you had done the same with Claudio.
Go get him. Let me see him.
</T>
<T>
ESCALUS
Lord Angelo, I am sorry that someone so educated and wise, as you always appeared to be, should slip so badly, both in the heat of desire and the lack of judgment afterward.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
I am sorry that I cause such sorrow, and it sticks so deeply in my penitent heart that it makes me crave death more than mercy. I deserve death, and beg for it.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Which one is this Barnardine?
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
This one, my lord.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
A certain friar told me about this man. (to BARNARDINE) Fellow, youre said to have a stubborn soul, one that cant imagine an existence beyond this one, and shapes your life accordingly. Youre doomed. But I pardon you for all your crimes here on earth, and hope youll take advantage of this mercy to prepare for the better world to come. Friar, counsel him. I leave him in your hands. Whos that covered-up fellow?
</T>
<T>
PROVOST
This is another prisoner I saved, who should have died when Claudio lost his head. He looks almost exactly like Claudio.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
(to ISABELLA) If he resembles your brother, then for his sake, hes pardoned. And for your own lovely sake, give me your hand and say youll be mine. Hes my brother, too, but therell be a more appropriate time for that. By the way Angelo is behaving, I think he realizes this means hes safe. Well, Angelo, your evil has repaid you well. Make sure you love your wife since her worth is equal to yours. Im feeling merciful, and yet heres someone I cant forgive. (to LUCIO) You, who called me a fool, a coward, a lecher, an ass, a madman. What did I ever do to you that you call me these things?
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
I swear, my lord, I only spoke according to what people say of you. You can hang me for it, if you want, but I wouldnt mind if you preferred to whip me.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
Whipping first, sir, and hanging afterward. Proclaim it, provost, around the city, that if this lecher wronged any woman, as I heard him swear himself he got someone pregnant, let her appear, and hell marry her. After the wedding, let him be whipped and hanged.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
I beg your highness, dont marry me to a whore. Your highness just said I made you a duke. My good lord, dont pay me back by making me husband of a cheating wife.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
By my honor, you will marry her. I forgive your slurs, and in so doing, lift your other punishments. Take him to prison, and see that my wishes are carried out.
</T>
<T>
LUCIO
Marrying a whore, my lord, is like being pressed to deatha type of torture in which stones were piled upon a person until he confessed or was crushedpressed to death, whipped, and hanged.
</T>
<T>
DUKE VINCENTIO
You deserve it for slandering a prince.
</T>
<T>
Claudio, the girl you wronged, make sure you marry her. Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo. Ive heard her confession, and I know her virtue. Thanks, good friend Escalus, for being so good. A greater expression of my gratitude is yet to come. Thanks, provost, for your care and ability to keep secrets. Im going to give you a better position. Forgive him, Angelo, for bringing you Ragozines head in place of Claudios. The crime redeems itself. Dear Isabel, I have a proposal thats greatly to your benefit, if youll lend a willing ear. Its along the lines of whats mine is yours, and whats yours is mine. So, accompany me to my palace, where Ill show and tell you everything you ought to know.
